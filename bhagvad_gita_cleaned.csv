1,1,धृतराष्ट्र उवाच | धर्मक्षेत्रे कुरुक्षेत्रे समवेता युयुत्सवः | मामकाः पाण्डवाश्चैव किमकुर्वत सञ्जय ॥1॥,"Dhritarastra said: O Sanjaya, what did my sons and the sons of Pandu actually do when, eager for battle, they gathered together on the holy field of Kuruksetra?","The two armies had gathered on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, well prepared to fight a war that was inevitable. Still, in this verse, King Dhritarashtra asked Sanjay, what his sons and his brother Pandu’s sons were doing on the battlefield? It was apparent that they would fight, then why did he ask such a question?The blind King Dhritarashtra’s fondness for his own sons had clouded his spiritual wisdom and deviated him from the path of virtue. He had usurped the kingdom of Hastinapur from the rightful heirs; the Pandavas, sons of his brother Pandu. Feeling guilty of the injustice he had done towards his nephews, his conscience worried him about the outcome of this battle.The words dharma kṣhetre, the land of dharma (virtuous conduct) used by Dhritarashtra depict the dilemma he was experiencing.  Kurukshetra is described as kurukṣhetraṁ deva yajanam in the Shatapath Brahman, the Vedic textbook detailing rituals. It means “Kurukshetra is the sacrificial arena of the celestial gods.” Hence, it was regarded as the sacred land that nourished dharma. Dhritarashtra feared that the holy land might influence the minds of his sons. If it aroused the faculty of discrimination, they might turn away from killing their cousins and negotiate a truce. A peaceful settlement meant that the Pandavas would continue being a hindrance for them. He felt great displeasure at these possibilities, instead preferred that this war transpires. He was uncertain of the consequences of the war, yet desired to determine the fate of his sons. Therefore, he asked Sanjay about the activities of the two armies on the battleground.",the two armies gathered battlefield kurukshetra well prepared fight war inevitable still verse king dhritarashtra asked sanjay sons brother pandu sons battlefield it apparent would fight ask question the blind king dhritarashtra fondness sons clouded spiritual wisdom deviated path virtue he usurped kingdom hastinapur rightful heirs pandavas sons brother pandu feeling guilty injustice done towards nephews conscience worried outcome battlethe words dharma kṣhetre land dharma virtuous conduct used dhritarashtra depict dilemma experiencing kurukshetra described kurukṣhetraṁ deva yajanam shatapath brahman vedic textbook detailing rituals it means kurukshetra sacrificial arena celestial gods hence regarded sacred land nourished dharma dhritarashtra feared holy land might influence minds sons if aroused faculty discrimination might turn away killing cousins negotiate truce a peaceful settlement meant pandavas would continue hindrance he felt great displeasure possibilities instead preferred war transpires he uncertain consequences war yet desired determine fate sons therefore asked sanjay activities two armies battleground
1,2,सञ्जय उवाच । दृष्ट्वा तु पाण्डवानीकं व्यूढं दुर्योधनस्तदा । आचार्यमुपसङ्गम्य राजा वचनमब्रवीत् ॥2॥,"Sanjaya said: But then, seeing the army of the Pandavas in battle array, King Duryodhana approached his teacher (Dronacharya) and spoke the following words:","Sanjay understood Dhritarashtra’s concern, who wanted an assurance that the battle would eventuate. Sanjay tried to allay his worry by informing that the Pandava army was standing in a military formation, ready for battle. Then he moved on to tell him what his son Duryodhana was doing on the battlefield.As King Dhritarashtra was blind, his eldest son Duryodhana virtually ruled the kingdom of Hastinapur. In the Mahabharata, he is described as very rude, egoistic, evil and cruel by nature. Since his childhood, he had a strong dislike for the Pandavas and left no opportunity to demean them. He was aware that to rule over the entire kingdom of Hastinapur unchallenged he needed to eliminate them. However, standing on the battlefield, when he saw the large Pandava army, he was baffled.  He had underestimated the Pandavas, the extent of military might they had gathered was way beyond his expectation.Duryodhana approached his guru Dronacharya with the pretense of offering respect, but his actual purpose was to palliate his own nervousness. His move towards his guru also reveals that the mammoth military formation of the Pandava army unnerved him and he was now fearful of the outcome of this war.The next nine verses are spoken by Duryodhan.",sanjay understood dhritarashtra concern wanted assurance battle would eventuate sanjay tried allay worry informing pandava army standing military formation ready battle then moved tell son duryodhana battlefieldas king dhritarashtra blind eldest son duryodhana virtually ruled kingdom hastinapur in mahabharata described rude egoistic evil cruel nature since childhood strong dislike pandavas left opportunity demean he aware rule entire kingdom hastinapur unchallenged needed eliminate however standing battlefield saw large pandava army baffled he underestimated pandavas extent military might gathered way beyond expectationduryodhana approached guru dronacharya pretense offering respect actual purpose palliate nervousness his move towards guru also reveals mammoth military formation pandava army unnerved fearful outcome warthe next nine verses spoken duryodhan

He was also one of Dronacharya’s pupils. Duryodhana was subtly reminding his teacher of a mistake he had committed in the past.Many years back, Dronacharya along with the Pandavas had defeated King Drupad in a battle and took away half his kingdom. To avenge his defeat, Drupad performed a sacrifice to beget a son. Dhristadyumna was born out of that sacrificial fire, with a boon that he would kill Dronacharya in the future. Even though Dronacharya was aware, when he was approached for Dhristadyumna’s military training, he very humbly accepted and imparted all his knowledge impartially to his pupil.Duryodhana was reminding Dronacharya that even though Dhristadyumna was his pupil, he was also Drupad’s son, with a boon to kill him. He wanted to ensure that as in the past, Dhronacharya should not become lenient towards his pupils, now that, they were on the battlefield.",duryodhana asked dronacharya look skillfully arranged military phalanx pandava army led commanderinchief dhristadyumna king dhrupad son he also one dronacharya pupils duryodhana subtly reminding teacher mistake committed pastmany years back dronacharya along pandavas defeated king drupad battle took away half kingdom to avenge defeat drupad performed sacrifice beget son dhristadyumna born sacrificial fire boon would kill dronacharya future even though dronacharya aware approached dhristadyumna military training humbly accepted imparted knowledge impartially pupilduryodhana reminding dronacharya even though dhristadyumna pupil also drupad son boon kill he wanted ensure past dhronacharya not become lenient towards pupils battlefield

He had never expected his opponents would mobilize an army of warriors with such military prowess, who would be formidable in battle.

I speak of them to you by way of example.","Dronacharya was a teacher of military science and not really a warrior. However, he was on the battlefield as one of the commanders of the Kaurava army. An impudent Duryodhana even doubted the loyalty of his own preceptor. Cunning Duryodhana purposefully addressed his teacher as dwijottama (best amongst the twice-born, or Brahmins). His denigrating and vailed reminder for Dronacharya was that, if he did not display his valor in this battle, he would be considered a lowly Brahmin, who was only interested in the fine food and lavish lifestyle at the king’s palace.Then to cover up his vicious words and boost his teacher’s and his own morale; Duryodhana started naming all the great generals present on the Kaurava side, describing their valor and military expertise.",dronacharya teacher military science not really warrior however battlefield one commanders kaurava army an impudent duryodhana even doubted loyalty preceptor cunning duryodhana purposefully addressed teacher dwijottama best amongst twiceborn brahmins his denigrating vailed reminder dronacharya not display valor battle would considered lowly brahmin interested fine food lavish lifestyle king palacethen cover vicious words boost teacher morale duryodhana started naming great generals present kaurava side describing valor military expertise

But the army of these (enemies), under the protection of Bhima and others is limited.","The commander-in-chief of the Kaurava army was Grandsire Bheeshma. Apart from being an exceptional warrior, he had an extraordinary boon. He could choose the time of his death, this meant he was practically invincible. Duryodhana felt that under Bheeshma’s command their army was undefeatable. Whereas, the Pandava army was secured by Duryodhana’s sworn enemy, Bheema. Hence, he started comparing his Grandfather Bheeshma’s strength with his cousin Bheema.Vinaash kale vipreet buddhi as the proverb goes, which means that when the end draws near, egoistic people indulge in vainglory instead of being humble in evaluating their situation. This tragic irony of fate is reflected here in Duryodhana’s self-aggrandizing statement that; their army’s strength secured by Bheeshma was unlimited.However, both Kauravas and Pandavas were Bheeshma’s grandchildren and as the oldest living member of the Kuru family, he was concerned about their welfare. He was compassionate towards the Pandavas, but was bound by his ethical commitment towards the throne of Hastinapur and its subjects. Therefore, halfheartedly, he led the Kaurava army against them.Bheeshma was also aware that in this holy war, along with all the great warriors of the world the Supreme Lord Krishna Himself was present. Lord Krishna was with the Pandavas, which meant Dharma was on their side, and no power in the entire universe could make the side of Adharma win.He had vowed to protect the kingdom of Hastinapur and its subjects and to fulfill his responsibility towards them Bheeshma led the Kaurava army, even though he was aware of their wrongdoings.

However, he understood his grand-nephew’s anxiety and to cheer him up he blew his conch shell loudly. In olden days, blowing of the conch shell in the battlefield signaled the start of the war.

It is a combination of two words, Mā which refers to goddess Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity and dhav is used for husband. Goddess Lakshmi is Lord Vishnu’s wife, who is one of the many forms of Shree Krishna. This verse implies that the goddess of prosperity was with the Pandavas, and by her grace, they would be triumphant in this war and reclaim their kingdom soon.The sons of King Pandu are called Pandavas and it may be used for any of the five brothers.

If I was there, I would have made a bridge of arrows.” The Omniscient Lord asked him, “Alright, go ahead show me your bridge.”  Very skillfully Arjun showered thousands of arrows and made a huge bridge. Now, it was time to test it. Shree Krishna called upon great Hanuman for the job. As soon as Hanuman started walking on the bridge, it started crumbling under his feet. Arjun realized his folly; his bridge of arrows could not have upheld the weight of Lord Rama’s huge army. He asked for their forgiveness.

He started with the word “aho,” which means ‘alas’. He had enumerated all the possible catastrophes that were imminent if this war took place, but he was ignoring the very fact that if the wrongdoers were not punished, it would cause greater damage to the society.Often, we keep blaming the circumstances or others but turn a blind eye towards our own weaknesses. Arjun’s justification for not killing his greedy cousins and relatives was driven by his own attachment and compassion towards them. Even though he felt it was a sin to kill them, as they were his relatives, he did not realize that his sentiments were actually materialistic and not transcendental.

He had now surrendered to his grief and slumped into deep dejection. His condition was the creation of his own material attachments and caused his dereliction of duty. This was a completely unexpected behavior from someone who was considered the epitome of devotion and self-surrender to God. In fact, before the battle, when both parties were mobilizing their armies; given a choice between the entire armed Yadu army and the unarmed Lord Shree Krishna; Arjun chose the Lord, as he had complete faith in him.At this point let us consider who Arjun really was. He was definitely not a novice, bereft of spiritual knowledge. His celestial father was Indra, the king of heaven. Arjun had been to his abode and received several boons from him and other celestial beings. In his past life, Arjun was Nar, part of the twin descensions the Nar-Narayan; where Nar was the perfected soul situated in transcendental knowledge and Narayan the Supreme Lord. Then why in the battlefield of Kurukshetra, a grand warrior of such stature was dropping his weapons? What was the cause of his misery? For the benefit of future generations, Shree Krishna wanted to bring forth the knowledge of the Bhagavad Gita. By intentionally confusing Arjun, the Lord had created this opportunity. In this chapter, Arjun put forth to the Lord several arguments and justifications why he should not fight this war, and in the subsequent chapters Shree Krishna has elaborated upon why Arjun’s arguments were inappropriate, and the way forward.",arjun reluctance fight war reached climax he surrendered grief slumped deep dejection his condition creation material attachments caused dereliction duty this completely unexpected behavior someone considered epitome devotion selfsurrender god in fact battle parties mobilizing armies given choice entire armed yadu army unarmed lord shree krishna arjun chose lord complete faith himat point let us consider arjun really he definitely not novice bereft spiritual knowledge his celestial father indra king heaven arjun abode received several boons celestial beings in past life arjun nar part twin descensions narnarayan nar perfected soul situated transcendental knowledge narayan supreme lord then battlefield kurukshetra grand warrior stature dropping weapons what cause misery for benefit future generations shree krishna wanted bring forth knowledge bhagavad gita by intentionally confusing arjun lord created opportunity in chapter arjun put forth lord several arguments justifications not fight war subsequent chapters shree krishna elaborated upon arjun arguments inappropriate way forward

But, by killing the elders we shall only be enjoying here the pleasures of wealth and desirable things drenched in blood.","It could be argued that Arjun needed to fight and win the kingdom to maintain his livelihood. But, Arjun refutes that line of thought here. He says that he would prefer to live by begging than commit this heinous crime. He further believes that if he does indulge in this heinous act of fighting the war and kills his elders and relatives, his conscience will not allow him to enjoy any of the fruits of his action in this world, such as riches and power.Shakespeare’s play Macbeth carries a telling example of a person not being able to enjoy even the natural state of sleep due to guilty conscience, let alone enjoy any wealth and power that comes along by immoral conduct. Macbeth was a nobleman of Scotland. Once while travelling, the king of Scotland came to rest the night at his house. Macbeth’s wife incited him to murder the king and usurp his throne. Macbeth got swayed by her advice and assassinated the king, and thereafter, he and Lady Macbeth were crowned as the king and queen of Scotland. However, for years after that, Macbeth would be found walking in his palace, fully awake at night. The author writes, “Macbeth hath killed sleep, and so Macbeth shall sleep no more.” The queen would be found repeatedly washing her hands, as if to remove imaginary blood stains. In this verse, Arjun commiserates that, if he did kill these noble elders, tainted with their blood, his conscience would not let him enjoy all the royal benefits of ruling the kingdom.",it could argued arjun needed fight win kingdom maintain livelihood but arjun refutes line thought he says would prefer live begging commit heinous crime he believes indulge heinous act fighting war kills elders relatives conscience not allow enjoy fruits action world riches powershakespeare play macbeth carries telling example person not able enjoy even natural state sleep due guilty conscience let alone enjoy wealth power comes along immoral conduct macbeth nobleman scotland once travelling king scotland came rest night house macbeth wife incited murder king usurp throne macbeth got swayed advice assassinated king thereafter lady macbeth crowned king queen scotland however years macbeth would found walking palace fully awake night the author writes macbeth hath killed sleep macbeth shall sleep more the queen would found repeatedly washing hands remove imaginary blood stains in verse arjun commiserates kill noble elders tainted blood conscience would not let enjoy royal benefits ruling kingdom
2,6,न चैतद्विद्म: कतरन्नो गरीयो यद्वा जयेम यदि वा नो जयेयु: | यानेव हत्वा न जिजीविषाम स्तेऽवस्थिता: प्रमुखे धार्तराष्ट्रा: ॥6॥,"We do not know this as well as to which is the better for us, (and) whether we shall win, or whether they shall conquer us. Those very sons of Dhrtarastra, by killing whom we do not wish to live, stand in confrontation.","When evaluating the most suitable course of action, one considers various alternatives and their consequences. Arjun was debating whether it would be desirable to defeat the Kauravas or to be defeated by them. Both alternatives seemed like defeat, for if he did win the war by slaying the Kauravas, he would have no further desire to live.However, the fact was that Bheeshma, Dronacharya, Kripacharya, etc. had acted ignobly by taking the side of the unrighteous Kauravas. The word arthakām has been used for them, implying, “attached to wealth and position,” they had taken the side of the wicked Duryodhan. So, killing them in the war was a natural consequence. In fact, after the war, Bheeshma himself admitted that a teacher who acts ignobly is fit to be abandoned.Here, special mention needs to be made of Bheeshma. According to the Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam (verse 9.22.19), he was a great devotee of Shree Krishna. He was a master of his senses, and an icon of chivalry and generosity. He was a knower of the Absolute Truth, and had vowed to always speak the truth in his life. Even death could only come to him when he chose to accept it. For various reasons, he is enumerated amongst the twelve great personalities, or Mahājans, mentioned in the Bhāgavatam:swayambhūr nāradaḥ śhambhuḥ kumāraḥ kapilo manuḥprahlādo janako bhīṣhmo balir vaiyāsakir vayam (6.3.20) [v1]“These are the twelve great knowers of religious principles—the first-born Brahma, Sage Narad, Lord Shiv, the four Kumars, Bhagavan Kapil (son of Devahuti), Svayambhuva Manu, Prahlad Maharaj, Janak Maharaj, Grandfather Bheeshma, Bali Maharaj, Shukadev Muni, and Ved Vyas.”Hence, Bheeshma was an enlightened soul, whose actions could never be against the principles of dharma. However, his profound character was beyond mundane reasoning. Even though he fought on the side of the Kauravas, he said to Yudhishthir (the eldest of the Pandava brothers) before the war, “I am obliged to combat on the side of unrighteousness, but I give you the boon that you will be victorious.” Bheeshma knew that the righteous Pandavas, who had the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna on their side, could never lose. By taking the side of adharma (unrighteousness), he showed that even the biggest forces on heaven and earth could not make unholiness win in this holy war. He thus offered the biggest sacrifice of laying down his life, to assist the divine pastimes of Lord Krishna.Shree Krishna was well aware of Bheeshma’s deep devotion toward him, despite his fighting from the side of the Kauravas. That is why he upheld Bheeshma’s vow by breaking his own. Bheeshma resolved on a particular day during the war, that before sunset on the next day, he would either kill Arjun, the foremost Pandava warrior, or else to save him, Shree Krishna would have to break his own vow of not lifting weapons in the battle of Mahabharat. Poets describe the vow that Bheeshma made:āju jo harihiṅ na śhastra gahāūñ,tau lājahuñ gaṅgā jananī ko śhāntanu suta na kahāūñ(Saint Tulsidas) [v2]“If I do not make the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna lift weapons, then I will shame my mother Ganga, and I am not the son of King Shantanu.” Bheeshma fought so valiantly that Arjun’s chariot was shattered, and he was stranded on the ground. At that stage, Shree Krishna lifted the chariot wheel and came forward to prevent Bheeshma from killing Arjun. Bheeshma saw the Lord with the chariot wheel in his hand as a weapon, and broke into a big smile. He understood that Bhaktavatsala Bhagavān (God who gives pleasure to his devotees) had broken his own vow to honor the vow of his devotee.In fact, Bheeshma’s devotion to Lord Krishna had a very rasik (full of sweetness) flavor to it. He used to meditate on Shree Krishna’s pastimes in Vrindavan. There, in the evening when the Lord would return to the village after grazing the cows in the forest, the dust raised from the hooves of the cows would deck his charming face, increasing its beauty and sweetness. During the battle of Mahabharat, the dust raised from the hooves of the horses too added to Shree Krishna’s beauty, and he loved having darśhan (divine vision) of his Lord there.In the last stage of his life, as he lay for six months on the bed of arrows, he meditated on that very vision of God, offering the following prayer to Him:yudhi turaga-rajo-vidhūmra-viṣhvak-kacha-lulita-śhramavāry-alaṅkṛitāsyemama niśhita-śharair vibhidyamāna-tvachi vilasat-kavache ’stu kṛiṣhṇa ātmā(Bhāgavatam 1.9.34) [v3]“On the battlefield, Lord Krishna’s flowing hair was covered with white dust raised by the hooves of the horses, and his face was covered with sweat beads because of his physical effort in driving the chariot. These were like ornaments enhancing the beauty of my Lord; and the wounds dealt by my sharp arrows further intensified the decorations. Let my mind meditate unto that Shree Krishna.”Lord Krishna reciprocated his loving devotion by himself coming to meet Bheeshma on his deathbed of arrows, and with the darśhan of God in front of him, Bheeshma, the great mahājan, left his body, of his own volition.",when evaluating suitable course action one considers various alternatives consequences arjun debating whether would desirable defeat kauravas defeated both alternatives seemed like defeat win war slaying kauravas would desire livehowever fact bheeshma dronacharya kripacharya etc acted ignobly taking side unrighteous kauravas the word arthakām used implying attached wealth position taken side wicked duryodhan so killing war natural consequence in fact war bheeshma admitted teacher acts ignobly fit abandonedhere special mention needs made bheeshma according śhrīmad bhāgavatam verse great devotee shree krishna he master senses icon chivalry generosity he knower absolute truth vowed always speak truth life even death could come chose accept for various reasons enumerated amongst twelve great personalities mahājans mentioned bhāgavatam swayambhūr nāradaḥ śhambhuḥ kumāraḥ kapilo manuḥprahlādo janako bhīṣhmo balir vaiyāsakir vayam these twelve great knowers religious firstborn brahma sage narad lord shiv four kumars bhagavan kapil son devahuti svayambhuva manu prahlad maharaj janak maharaj grandfather bheeshma bali maharaj shukadev muni ved vyas hence bheeshma enlightened soul whose actions could never principles dharma however profound character beyond mundane reasoning even though fought side kauravas said yudhishthir eldest pandava brothers war i obliged combat side unrighteousness i give boon victorious bheeshma knew righteous pandavas supreme lord shree krishna side could never lose by taking side adharma unrighteousness showed even biggest forces heaven earth could not make unholiness win holy war he thus offered biggest sacrifice laying life assist divine pastimes lord krishnashree krishna well aware bheeshma deep devotion toward despite fighting side kauravas that upheld bheeshma vow breaking bheeshma resolved particular day war sunset next day would either kill arjun foremost pandava warrior else save shree krishna would break vow not lifting weapons battle mahabharat poets describe vow bheeshma made āju jo harihiṅ na śhastra gahāūñ tau lājahuñ gaṅgā jananī ko śhāntanu suta na kahāūñ saint tulsidas if i not make supreme lord shree krishna lift weapons i shame mother ganga i not son king shantanu bheeshma fought valiantly arjun chariot shattered stranded ground at stage shree krishna lifted chariot wheel came forward prevent bheeshma killing arjun bheeshma saw lord chariot wheel hand weapon broke big smile he understood bhaktavatsala bhagavān god gives pleasure devotees broken vow honor vow devoteein fact bheeshma devotion lord krishna rasik full sweetness flavor he used meditate shree krishna pastimes vrindavan there evening lord would return village grazing cows forest dust raised hooves cows would deck charming face increasing beauty sweetness during battle mahabharat dust raised hooves horses added shree krishna beauty loved darśhan divine vision lord therein last stage life lay six months bed arrows meditated vision god offering following prayer him yudhi turagarajovidhūmraviṣhvakkachalulitaśhramavāryalaṅkṛitāsyemama niśhitaśharair vibhidyamānatvachi vilasatkavache stu kṛiṣhṇa ātmā bhāgavatam on battlefield lord krishna flowing hair covered white dust raised hooves horses face covered sweat beads physical effort driving chariot these like ornaments enhancing beauty lord wounds dealt sharp arrows intensified decorations let mind meditate unto shree krishna lord krishna reciprocated loving devotion coming meet bheeshma deathbed arrows darśhan god front bheeshma great mahājan left body volition

Tell me for certain that which is better; I am Your disciple. Instruct me who have taken refuge in You.","This is a great moment in the Bhagavad Gita, when for the first time Arjun, who is Shree Krishna’s friend and cousin, requests him to be his Guru. Arjun pleads to Shree Krishna that he has been overpowered by kārpaṇya doṣh, or the flaw of cowardice in behavior, and so he requests the Lord to become his Guru and instruct him about the path of auspiciousness.All the Vedic scriptures declare in unison that it is through the medium of a Spiritual Master that we receive divine knowledge for our eternal welfare:tadvijñānārthaṁ sagurumevābhigachchhet samitpāniḥ śhrotriyaṁ bhramhaniṣhṭham (Muṇḍakopaniṣhad 1.2.12) [v4]“To know the Absolute Truth, approach a Guru who is both a knower of the scriptures and is practically situated on the platform of God-realization.”tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta jijñāsuḥ śhreya uttamamśhābde pare cha niṣhṇātaṁ brahmaṇy upaśhamāśhrayam(Bhāgavatam 11.3.21) [v5]“Seekers of the Truth should surrender themselves to a Spiritual Master who has understood the conclusion of the scriptures and taken complete shelter of God, leaving aside all material considerations.”The Ramayan states:guru binu bhava nidhi tarai na koī, jauṅ biranchi sankara sama hoī. [v6]“Not even the most elevated of spiritual aspirants can cross over the material ocean without the grace of the Guru.” Shree Krishna states this himself in the Bhagavad Gita in verse 4.34: “Learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him with reverence and render service unto him. Such an enlightened Saint can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.”To demonstrate the need for accepting a Guru to gain knowledge, Shree Krishna himself took this step. In his youth, he went to the hermitage of Sandipani Muni to learn sixty-four sciences from him. His classmate, Sudama, remarked regarding this:yasya chchhando mayaṁ brahma deha āvapanaṁ vibhośhreyasāṁ tasya guruṣhu vāso ’tyanta viḍambanam(Bhāgavatam 10.80.45) [v7]“O Shree Krishna, the Vedas are like your body, manifested from the knowledge that you possess (hence, what requirement do you have for making a Guru). Yet, you too pretend you need to learn from a Guru; this is only your divine leela (pastime).” Shree Krishna is in fact the first Guru of the world, because he is the Guru of Brahma, the first-born in this material world. He performed this leela for our benefit, to teach by his example that we souls, who are under the influence of Maya, will need a Guru to dispel our ignorance. In this verse, Arjun takes the step of surrendering to Shree Krishna as his disciple, and requests his Guru to enlighten him regarding the proper course of action.",this great moment bhagavad gita first time arjun shree krishna friend cousin requests guru arjun pleads shree krishna overpowered kārpaṇya doṣh flaw cowardice behavior requests lord become guru instruct path auspiciousnessall vedic scriptures declare unison medium spiritual master receive divine knowledge eternal welfare tadvijñānārthaṁ sagurumevābhigachchhet samitpāniḥ śhrotriyaṁ bhramhaniṣhṭham muṇḍakopaniṣhad to know absolute truth approach guru knower scriptures practically situated platform godrealization tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta jijñāsuḥ śhreya uttamamśhābde pare cha niṣhṇātaṁ brahmaṇy upaśhamāśhrayam bhāgavatam seekers truth surrender spiritual master understood conclusion scriptures taken complete shelter god leaving aside material considerations the ramayan states guru binu bhava nidhi tarai na koī jauṅ biranchi sankara sama hoī not even elevated spiritual aspirants cross material ocean without grace guru shree krishna states bhagavad gita verse learn truth approaching spiritual master inquire reverence render service unto such enlightened saint impart knowledge unto seen truth to demonstrate need accepting guru gain knowledge shree krishna took step in youth went hermitage sandipani muni learn sixtyfour sciences his classmate sudama remarked regarding yasya chchhando mayaṁ brahma deha āvapanaṁ vibhośhreyasāṁ tasya guruṣhu vāso tyanta viḍambanam bhāgavatam o shree krishna vedas like body manifested knowledge possess hence requirement making guru yet pretend need learn guru divine leela pastime shree krishna fact first guru world guru brahma firstborn material world he performed leela benefit teach example souls influence maya need guru dispel ignorance in verse arjun takes step surrendering shree krishna disciple requests guru enlighten regarding proper course action

Such is the equanimous attitude exhibited by someone with knowledge in all situations.With our incomplete understanding, we find faults with the situations we are in—we complain and grumble about them, wish to run away from them, and hold them responsible for our misery. But the enlightened souls inform us that the world created by God is perfect in every way, and both good and bad situations come to us for a divine purpose. They are all arranged for our spiritual evolution, to push us upward in our journey toward perfection. Those who understand this secret are never disturbed in difficult circumstances, facing them with serenity and tranquility.“The snowflakes fall slowly to the ground, each flake in its proper place” is a famous Taoist expression. It beautifully expresses the inherent perfection in the design of the world and the macro events taking place in it, even though we are not able to perceive it from our material perspective.The Chhāndogya Upaniṣhad explains why earthquakes, hurricanes, cyclones, floods, and typhoons are created in the world by God, as a part of the grand scheme of things. It states that God deliberately creates difficult situations to prevent people from slowing down in their journey of spiritual progress. When people become complacent, a natural calamity comes along, forcing the souls to strain their abilities to cope with it, which ensures their progress. However, it must be noted that the progress being talked about here is not the external increase of material luxuries, but the internal unfoldment of the glorious divinity of the soul over a continuum of lifetime.",in sharp contrast arjun words lamentation shree krishna smiled displaying situation not making despair rather perfectly happy such equanimous attitude exhibited someone knowledge situationswith incomplete understanding find faults situations complain grumble wish run away hold responsible misery but enlightened souls inform us world created god perfect every way good bad situations come us divine purpose they arranged spiritual evolution push us upward journey toward perfection those understand secret never disturbed difficult circumstances facing serenity tranquility the snowflakes fall slowly ground flake proper place famous taoist expression it beautifully expresses inherent perfection design world macro events taking place even though not able perceive material perspectivethe chhāndogya upaniṣhad explains earthquakes hurricanes cyclones floods typhoons created world god part grand scheme things it states god deliberately creates difficult situations prevent people slowing journey spiritual progress when people become complacent natural calamity comes along forcing souls strain abilities cope ensures progress however must noted progress talked not external increase material luxuries internal unfoldment glorious divinity soul continuum lifetime

The learned do not grieve for the departed and those who have not departed.,"Starting with this verse, Shree Krishna initiates his discourse with a dramatic opening statement. Arjun is lamenting, for what he feels are very valid reasons. But, rather than commiserating with him, Shree Krishna takes the wind out of his arguments. He says, “Arjun, though you may feel you are speaking words of wisdom, you are actually speaking and acting out of ignorance. No possible reason justifies lamentation. The Pundits—those who are wise—never lament, neither for the living nor for the dead. Hence the grief you visualize in killing your relatives is illusory, and it proves that you are not a Pundit.”One does not need to go far into the Gita to find a wise person above lamentation, for Grandsire Bheeshma himself was the perfect example. He was a sage who had fathomed the mysteries of life and death, and risen above the dualities of circumstances. Serene in any eventuality, he had even consented to taking the side of the wicked, if it served the Lord. He thus demonstrated that those who are surrendered to God simply do their duty in all situations, without being affected by outcomes. Such persons never lament because they accept all circumstances as God’s grace.",starting verse shree krishna initiates discourse dramatic opening statement arjun lamenting feels valid reasons but rather commiserating shree krishna takes wind arguments he says arjun though may feel speaking words wisdom actually speaking acting ignorance no possible reason justifies lamentation the lament neither living dead hence grief visualize killing relatives illusory proves not pundit one not need go far gita find wise person lamentation grandsire bheeshma perfect example he sage fathomed mysteries life death risen dualities circumstances serene eventuality even consented taking side wicked served lord he thus demonstrated surrendered god simply duty situations without affected outcomes such persons never lament accept circumstances god grace
2,12,न त्वेवाहं जातु नासं न त्वं नेमे जनाधिपा | न चैव न भविष्याम: सर्वे वयमत: परम् ॥12॥,"But certainly (it is) not (a fact) that I did not exist at any time; nor you, nor these rulers of men. And surely it is not that we all shall cease to exist after this.","On the gate of the temple of Apollo at Delphi are inscribed the words, Gnothi Seuton, or “Know Thyself [v8].” Even Socrates, the wise old man of Athens, was fond of encouraging people to inquire into the nature of the self. A local legend goes like this. Once, Socrates was walking on the street, absorbed in deep philosophic contemplation, when he accidentally bumped into someone. That man blurted in annoyance, “Can’t you see where you walk? Who are you?” Socrates answered with amusement, “My dear fellow, I have been pondering over that question for the last forty years. If you ever come to know who I am, please let me know.”In the Vedic tradition, whenever divine knowledge is imparted, it usually begins with knowledge of the self. Shree Krishna follows the same approach in the Bhagavad Gita, with a piece of information that would have swept Socrates off his feet. Shree Krishna begins by explaining that the entity that we call the “self” is really the soul, not the material body, and is eternal, just as God himself is eternal. The Śhwetāśhvatar Upaniṣhad states:jñājñau dwāvajā vīśhanīśhāvajā hyekā bhoktṛi bhogyārtha yuktāanantaśhchātmā viśhwarūpo hyakartā trayaṁ yadā vindate brahmametat (1.9) [v9]The above verse states that creation is a combination of three entities—God, soul, and Maya—and all the three entities are eternal. If we believe the soul is eternal, then it follows logically that there is life after death of the material body. Shree Krishna talks about this in the next verse.",on gate temple apollo delphi inscribed words gnothi seuton know thyself even socrates wise old man athens fond encouraging people inquire nature self a local legend goes like once socrates walking street absorbed deep philosophic contemplation accidentally bumped someone that man blurted annoyance can see walk who socrates answered amusement my dear fellow i pondering question last forty years if ever come know i please let know in vedic tradition whenever divine knowledge imparted usually begins knowledge self shree krishna follows approach bhagavad gita piece information would swept socrates feet shree krishna begins explaining entity call self really soul not material body eternal god eternal the śhwetāśhvatar upaniṣhad states jñājñau dwāvajā vīśhanīśhāvajā hyekā bhoktṛi bhogyārtha yuktāanantaśhchātmā viśhwarūpo hyakartā trayaṁ yadā vindate brahmametat the verse states creation combination three soul three entities eternal if believe soul eternal follows logically life death material body shree krishna talks next verse
2,13,देहिनोऽस्मिन्यथा देहे कौमारं यौवनं जरा | तथा देहान्तरप्राप्तिर्धीरस्तत्र न मुह्यति ॥13॥,"As are boyhood, youth and decay to an embodied being in this (present) body, similar is the acquisition of another body. This being so, an intelligent person does not get deluded.","With immaculate logic, Shree Krishna establishes the principle of transmigration of the soul from lifetime to lifetime. He explains that in one lifetime itself, we change bodies from childhood to youth to maturity and then to old age. In fact, modern science informs us that cells within the body undergo regeneration—old cells die away and new ones take their place. It is estimated that within seven years, practically all the cells of the body change. Further, the molecules within the cells change even more rapidly. With every breath we inhale, oxygen molecules are absorbed into our cells via the metabolic processes, and molecules that were heretofore locked within the cells are released as carbon dioxide. Scientists estimate that in one year’s time, about ninety-eight percent of our bodily molecules change. And yet, despite the continual change of the body, we perceive that we are the same person. That is because we are not the material body, but the spiritual soul seated within.In this verse, the word deha means “the body” and dehi means “possessor of the body,” or the soul. Shree Krishna draws Arjun’s attention to the fact that, since the body is constantly changing, in one lifetime itself, the soul passes through many bodies. Similarly, at the time of death, it passes into another body. Actually, what we term as “death” in worldly parlance is merely the soul discarding its old dysfunctional body, and what we call “birth” is the soul taking on a new body elsewhere. This is the principle of reincarnation.Most Oriental philosophies accept this concept of reincarnation. It is an integral part of Hinduism, Jainism, and Sikhism. In Buddhism, the Buddha made references to his past lives repeatedly. Many people do not know the extent to which reincarnation was a part of the belief system of the Occidental philosophies as well. In ancient classical Western religious and philosophic circles, famous thinkers such as Pythagoras, Plato, and Socrates accepted reincarnation to be true, and their views were also reflected in Orphism, Hermeticism, Neoplatonism, Manicheanism, and Gnosticism. Within the mainstream Abrahamic faiths, mystics of the three major religions also supported reincarnation. Examples include Jews who studied the Kabbalah, the Christian Cathars, and Muslim Shia sects such as the Alawi Shias and the Druze. For example, amongst Occidental religions, Josephus, the great ancient Jewish historian, used language in his writings that seem to ascribe belief in some form of reincarnation among the Pharisees and Essenes of his day. Certainly the Jewish Kabbalah prescribes to the idea of reincarnation as gilgul neshamot, or the “rolling of the soul.” The great Sufi mystic, Maulana Jalaluddin Rumi declared:I died out of the stone and I became a plant;I died out of the plant and became an animal;I died out of the animal and became a man.Why then should I fear to die?When did I grow less by dying?I shall die out of man and shall become an angel!” [v10]Many of the early Christians believed in the concept of reincarnation. Christian history informs us that, in the 553 AD, the Council of Nicaea, a conclave, was held to discuss the principle of reincarnation, and it was thereafter declared a heresy, apparently to increase the authority of the Church over the lives of the people. Until then, it was commonly accepted. Jesus indirectly proclaimed this doctrine when he told his disciples that John the Baptist was Elijah the Prophet reincarnated (Matthew 11:13-14, Matthew 17:10-13). This is also mentioned in the Old Testament (Malachi 4:5). Origen, the most learned of the Christian Fathers, declared: “Every man receives a body for himself according to his deserts in former lives [v11].” Solomon’s Book of Wisdom says: “To be born in sound body with sound limbs is a reward of the virtues of the past lives.” (Wisdom of Solomon 8:19-20) [v12]Belief in reincarnation is also found in many tribal societies around the world, in places such as Siberia, West Africa, North America, and Australia. Moving to more recent centuries and civilizations, reincarnation has been affirmed by Rosicrucians, Spiritism, Theosophists, and New Age followers. Even more recently, it has even been studied in serious scientific circles at major universities, exemplified by the works of Dr. Ian Stevenson and Dr. Jim Tucker, both at the University of Virginia.Without accepting the concept of rebirth, it is difficult to make sense out of the suffering, chaos, and incompleteness of the world, and hence, many famous western thinkers believed in this principle. Virgil and Ovid regarded this doctrine as self-evident. The German philosophers Goethe, Fichte, Schelling, and Lessing accepted it. Amongst the more recent philosophers, Hume, Spencer, and Max Mueller, all recognized it as an incontrovertible doctrine. Among Western poets, Browing, Rosetti, Tennyson, and Wordsworth, to mention just a few, all believed in it.Shree Krishna has previously declared that the wise do not lament. But the fact remains that we do experience happiness and distress. What is the reason for it? He now explains this concept.",with immaculate logic shree krishna establishes principle transmigration soul lifetime lifetime he explains one lifetime change bodies childhood youth maturity old age in fact modern science informs us cells within body undergo cells die away new ones take place it estimated within seven years practically cells body change further molecules within cells change even rapidly with every breath inhale oxygen molecules absorbed cells via metabolic processes molecules heretofore locked within cells released carbon dioxide scientists estimate one year time ninetyeight percent bodily molecules change and yet despite continual change body perceive person that not material body spiritual soul seated withinin verse word deha means body dehi means possessor body soul shree krishna draws arjun attention fact since body constantly changing one lifetime soul passes many bodies similarly time death passes another body actually term death worldly parlance merely soul discarding old dysfunctional body call birth soul taking new body elsewhere this principle reincarnationmost oriental philosophies accept concept reincarnation it integral part hinduism jainism sikhism in buddhism buddha made references past lives repeatedly many people not know extent reincarnation part belief system occidental philosophies well in ancient classical western religious philosophic circles famous thinkers pythagoras plato socrates accepted reincarnation true views also reflected orphism hermeticism neoplatonism manicheanism gnosticism within mainstream abrahamic faiths mystics three major religions also supported reincarnation examples include jews studied kabbalah christian cathars muslim shia sects alawi shias druze for example amongst occidental religions josephus great ancient jewish historian used language writings seem ascribe belief form reincarnation among pharisees essenes day certainly jewish kabbalah prescribes idea reincarnation gilgul neshamot rolling soul the great sufi mystic maulana jalaluddin rumi declared i died stone i became plant i died plant became animal i died animal became manwhy i fear die when i grow less dying i shall die man shall become angel many early christians believed concept reincarnation christian history informs us ad council nicaea conclave held discuss principle reincarnation thereafter declared heresy apparently increase authority church lives people until commonly accepted jesus indirectly proclaimed doctrine told disciples john baptist elijah prophet reincarnated matthew matthew this also mentioned old testament malachi origen learned christian fathers declared every man receives body according deserts former lives solomon book wisdom says to born sound body sound limbs reward virtues past lives wisdom solomon belief reincarnation also found many tribal societies around world places siberia west africa north america australia moving recent centuries civilizations reincarnation affirmed rosicrucians spiritism theosophists new age followers even recently even studied serious scientific circles major universities exemplified works dr ian stevenson dr jim tucker university virginiawithout accepting concept rebirth difficult make sense suffering chaos incompleteness world hence many famous western thinkers believed principle virgil ovid regarded doctrine selfevident the german philosophers goethe fichte schelling lessing accepted amongst recent philosophers hume spencer max mueller recognized incontrovertible doctrine among western poets browing rosetti tennyson wordsworth mention believed itshree krishna previously declared wise not lament but fact remains experience happiness distress what reason he explains concept
2,14,मात्रास्पर्शास्तु कौन्तेय शीतोष्णसुखदु: खदा: | आगमापायिनोऽनित्यास्तांस्तितिक्षस्व भारत ॥14॥,"But the contacts of the organs with the objects are the producers of cold and heat, happiness and sorrow. They have a beginning and an end, (and) are transient. Bear them, O descendant of Bharata.","The human body houses five senses—the senses of sight, smell, taste, touch, and hearing—and these, in contact with their objects of perception, give rise to sensations of happiness and distress. None of these sensations is permanent. They come and go like the changing seasons. Although cool water provides pleasure in the summer, the same water gives distress in the winter. Thus, both the perceptions of happiness and distress experienced through the senses are transitory. If we permit ourselves to be affected by them, we will sway like a pendulum from side to side. A person of discrimination should practice to tolerate both the feelings of happiness and distress without being disturbed by them.The technique of Vipassanā, which is the primary technique of self-realization in Buddhism, is based on this principle of tolerance of sense perceptions. Its practice helps eliminate desire, which, as stated in the four noble truths (the truth of suffering, the truth of the origin of suffering, the truth of the cessation of suffering, and the truth of the path leading to the cessation), is the cause of all suffering. This is not surprising considering that Buddhist philosophy is a subset of the vast Vedic philosophy.",the human body houses five senses sight smell taste touch contact objects perception give rise sensations happiness distress none sensations permanent they come go like changing seasons although cool water provides pleasure summer water gives distress winter thus perceptions happiness distress experienced senses transitory if permit affected sway like pendulum side side a person discrimination practice tolerate feelings happiness distress without disturbed themthe technique vipassanā primary technique selfrealization buddhism based principle tolerance sense perceptions its practice helps eliminate desire stated four noble truths truth suffering truth origin suffering truth cessation suffering truth path leading cessation cause suffering this not surprising considering buddhist philosophy subset vast vedic philosophy
2,15,यं हि न व्यथयन्त्येते पुरुषं पुरुषर्षभ | समदु:खसुखं धीरं सोऽमृतत्वाय कल्पते ॥15॥,"O (Arjuna, who are) foremost among men, verily, the person whom these do not torment, the wise man to whom sorrow and happiness are the same he is fit for Immortality.","In the previous verse, Shree Krishna explained that both the sensations of happiness and distress are fleeting. He now encourages Arjun to rise above these dualities through discrimination. In order to develop this discrimination, we first need to understand the answers to two important questions: 1) Why do we aspire for happiness? 2) Why doesn’t material happiness satisfy us?The answer to the first question is very simple. God is an ocean of infinite bliss, and we souls are his tiny parts. This basically means that we are tiny fragments of an infinite ocean of bliss. Swami Vivekananda would address people by saying, “O ye children of immortal bliss.” Just as a child is drawn to his or her mother, each part is naturally drawn toward its whole. Similarly, being infinitesimal parts of the ocean of bliss, we souls too are drawn to this bliss. Hence, everything we do in the world is for the sake of happiness. We all may have different views regarding where happiness lies or what form it might take, but all living beings seek nothing apart from it. This answers the first question.Now, let’s understand the answer to the second question. The soul, being a tiny part of God, is divine in nature like God himself. Hence the happiness that the soul seeks is also divine. Such happiness must possess the following three characteristics:It must be infinite in extent.It must be permanent.It must be ever-fresh.Such is the happiness of God, which is described as sat-chit-ānand, or eternal-sentient-ocean of bliss. However, the happiness we experience from the contact of the senses with their objects is the reverse; it is temporary, finite, and insentient. Thus, the material happiness that we perceive through the body can never satisfy the divine soul.With this discrimination, we must practice to tolerate the perception of material happiness. Similarly, we must tolerate the sensation of material distress. (This second aspect is discussed in detail in many future verses, such as 2.48, 5.20, etc.) Only then will we rise above these dualities and the material energy will no longer bind us.",in previous verse shree krishna explained sensations happiness distress fleeting he encourages arjun rise dualities discrimination in order develop discrimination first need understand answers two important questions why aspire happiness why material happiness satisfy us the answer first question simple god ocean infinite bliss souls tiny parts this basically means tiny fragments infinite ocean bliss swami vivekananda would address people saying o ye children immortal bliss just child drawn mother part naturally drawn toward whole similarly infinitesimal parts ocean bliss souls drawn bliss hence everything world sake happiness we may different views regarding happiness lies form might take living beings seek nothing apart this answers first questionnow let understand answer second question the soul tiny part god divine nature like god hence happiness soul seeks also divine such happiness must possess following three characteristics it must infinite extentit must permanentit must everfreshsuch happiness god described satchitānand eternalsentientocean bliss however happiness experience contact senses objects reverse temporary finite insentient thus material happiness perceive body never satisfy divine soulwith discrimination must practice tolerate perception material happiness similarly must tolerate sensation material distress this second aspect discussed detail many future verses etc only rise dualities material energy longer bind us
2,16,नासतो विद्यते भावो नाभावो विद्यते सत: | उभयोरपि दृष्टोऽन्तस्त्वनयोस्तत्वदर्शिभि: ॥16॥,"Of the unreal there is no being; the real has no nonexistence. But the nature of both these, indeed, has been realized by the seers of Truth.","According to the Śhwetāśhvatar Upaniṣhad, there are three entities in existence:bhoktā bhogyaṁ preritāraṁ cha matvā sarvaṁ proktaṁ trividhaṁ brahmametat (1.12) [v13]kṣharaṁ pradhānamamṛitākṣharaṁ haraḥ kṣharātmānāvīśhate deva ekaḥ (1.10) [v14]sanyuktametatkṣharamakṣharaṁ cha vyaktāvyaktaṁ bharate viśhvamīśhaḥ (1.8) [v15]All these Ved mantras state that these three entities—God, the individual soul, and Maya—are all eternal.1. God is everlasting. Thus he is sat (eternally existing). Hence, a name for him in the Vedas is sat-chit-ānand (eternal-full of knowledge-ocean of bliss).2. The soul is imperishable, and hence it is sat. However, the body will cease to exist one day, and hence it is asat (temporary). The soul is also sat-chit-ānand, but it is also aṇu (tiny). Hence the soul is aṇu sat, aṇu chit, and aṇu ānand.3. The entity Maya from which the world has been made is eternal, or sat. However, all material objects we see around us came into existence and will be destroyed with time. Thus, they can all be termed as asat, or temporary. So while the world itself is asat, it is only the entity Maya that is sat.When we say that the world is asat, this should not be confused with mithyā. Asat (temporary) does not mean mithyā (non-existent). Some philosophers claim that the world is mithyā, or “non-existent.” They assert that it is only the ignorance within us that is making us perceive the world, and once we are situated in brahma-jñāna (knowledge of the Supreme) the world will cease to exist. However, if this were true, then the world should no longer have remained for the God-realized Saints. Since they had destroyed their ignorance, the world should have stopped existing for them. Why then did these Saints write books even after attaining the state of God-realization? Where did the paper and pen come from? The fact that brahma-jñānīs use the objects of the world proves that the world exists even for them. Besides, even brahma-jñānīs need food to nourish their bodies. The Vedic scriptures state: paśhvādibhiśhchāviśheṣhat [v16] “Even God-realized Saints feels hungry, just as animals do, and need to eat food.” If the world does not exist for them, then how and why should they eat?Further, the Taittirīya Upaniṣhad repeatedly informs us that God is all-pervading in the world:so ’kāmayata bahu syāṁ prajāyeyeti sa tapo ’tapyata sa tapastaptvā idaṁsarvamasṛijata yadidaṁ kiṁ cha tatsṛiṣhtvā tadevānuprāviṣhat tadanupraviśhya sachcha tyachchābhavat niruktaṁ chāniruktaṁ cha nilayanaṁ chānilaynaṁ cha vijñānaṁ chāvijñānaṁ cha satyaṁ chānṛitam cha satyamabhavat yadidaṁ kiṁ cha tatsatyamityāchakṣhate tadapyeṣha śhloko bhavati (2.6.4) [v17]This Vedic mantra states that God not only created the world, but also permeates every atom of it. If God is truly all-pervading in this world, then how can the world have no existence? To say that the world is mithyā is to contradict the fact that God pervades the world. In this verse, Shree Krishna explains that the world does exist, but it is fleeting. Thus, he calls it as asat, or “temporary.” He does not call it mithyā, or “non-existent.”",according śhwetāśhvatar upaniṣhad three entities existence bhoktā bhogyaṁ preritāraṁ cha matvā sarvaṁ proktaṁ trividhaṁ brahmametat kṣharaṁ pradhānamamṛitākṣharaṁ haraḥ kṣharātmānāvīśhate deva ekaḥ sanyuktametatkṣharamakṣharaṁ cha vyaktāvyaktaṁ bharate viśhvamīśhaḥ all ved mantras state three individual soul god everlasting thus sat eternally existing hence name vedas satchitānand eternalfull knowledgeocean bliss the soul imperishable hence sat however body cease exist one day hence asat temporary the soul also satchitānand also aṇu tiny hence soul aṇu sat aṇu chit aṇu the entity maya world made eternal sat however material objects see around us came existence destroyed time thus termed asat temporary so world asat entity maya satwhen say world asat not confused mithyā asat temporary not mean mithyā nonexistent some philosophers claim world mithyā nonexistent they assert ignorance within us making us perceive world situated brahmajñāna knowledge supreme world cease exist however true world longer remained godrealized saints since destroyed ignorance world stopped existing why saints write books even attaining state godrealization where paper pen come the fact brahmajñānīs use objects world proves world exists even besides even brahmajñānīs need food nourish bodies the vedic scriptures state paśhvādibhiśhchāviśheṣhat even godrealized saints feels hungry animals need eat food if world not exist eat further taittirīya upaniṣhad repeatedly informs us god allpervading world kāmayata bahu syāṁ prajāyeyeti sa tapo tapyata sa tapastaptvā idaṁsarvamasṛijata yadidaṁ kiṁ cha tatsṛiṣhtvā tadevānuprāviṣhat tadanupraviśhya sachcha tyachchābhavat niruktaṁ chāniruktaṁ cha nilayanaṁ chānilaynaṁ cha vijñānaṁ chāvijñānaṁ cha satyaṁ chānṛitam cha satyamabhavat yadidaṁ kiṁ cha tatsatyamityāchakṣhate tadapyeṣha śhloko bhavati this vedic mantra states god not created world also permeates every atom if god truly allpervading world world existence to say world mithyā contradict fact god pervades world in verse shree krishna explains world exist fleeting thus calls asat temporary he not call mithyā nonexistent

None can bring about the destruction of this Immutable.,"Shree Krishna establishes the relationship between the body and the soul, by saying that the soul pervades the body. What does he mean by this? The soul is sentient, i.e. it possesses consciousness. The body is made from insentient matter, devoid of consciousness. However, the soul passes on the quality of consciousness to the body as well, by residing in it. Hence, the soul pervades the body by spreading its consciousness everywhere in it.Some raise a question here regarding the location of the soul. The Vedas state that the soul resides in the heart:hṛidi hyeṣha ātmā (Praśhnopaniṣhad 3.6) [v18]sa vā eṣha ātmā hṛidi (Chhāndogya Upaniṣhad 8.3.3) [v19]The word hṛidi indicates that the soul is seated in the region of the heart. Yet, consciousness, which is the symptom of the soul, spreads throughout the body. How does this happen? Ved Vyas explains this concept as follows: avirodhaśhchandanavat  (Brahma Sūtra 2.3.23) [v20]“Just as applying sandalwood to your forehead cools the entire body, similarly, the soul, although residing locally in the heart, infuses its consciousness throughout the body.”Again, someone may ask that if consciousness is a characteristic of the soul, then how does it spread into the body? This question has also been answered by Ved Vyas:vyaktireko gandhavat (Brahma Sūtra 2.3.26) [v21]“Fragrance is a quality of the flower. But the garden where the flower grows also becomes fragrant.” This means that the flower is able to pass on its fragrant quality to the garden. Likewise, the soul is sentient, and it also makes the dead matter of the body sentient, by pervading its consciousness in it.",shree krishna establishes relationship body soul saying soul pervades body what mean the soul sentient ie possesses consciousness the body made insentient matter devoid consciousness however soul passes quality consciousness body well residing hence soul pervades body spreading consciousness everywhere itsome raise question regarding location soul the vedas state soul resides heart hṛidi hyeṣha ātmā praśhnopaniṣhad sa vā eṣha ātmā hṛidi chhāndogya upaniṣhad the word hṛidi indicates soul seated region heart yet consciousness symptom soul spreads throughout body how happen ved vyas explains concept follows avirodhaśhchandanavat brahma sūtra just applying sandalwood forehead cools entire body similarly soul although residing locally heart infuses consciousness throughout body again someone may ask consciousness characteristic soul spread body this question also answered ved vyas vyaktireko gandhavat brahma sūtra fragrance quality flower but garden flower grows also becomes fragrant this means flower able pass fragrant quality garden likewise soul sentient also makes dead matter body sentient pervading consciousness

Similarly, in the illusion that we are the body, we fear the experience of death. For the enlightened soul whose illusion has been dispelled, this fear of death vanishes.One may ask that if nobody can kill anyone, then why is murder considered a punishable offense? The answer is that the body is the vehicle of the soul, and destroying any living being’s vehicle is violence, which is forbidden. The Vedas clearly instruct: mā hinsyāt sarvabhūtāni [v24] “Do not commit violence toward anyone.” In fact, the Vedas even consider killing of animals as a crime. However, there are occasions where the rules change and even violence becomes necessary. For example, in cases where a snake is approaching to bite, or if one is attacked with lethal weapons, or one’s life sustenance is being snatched away, then violence is permitted for self-protection. In the present situation, what is appropriate for Arjun, violence or non-violence, and why? Shree Krishna will explain this to him in great detail, as the dialogue of the Bhagavad Gita progresses. And in the course of the explanation, priceless divine knowledge will be revealed to shed light on the subject.",the illusion death created identify body the ramayan explains follows jauṅ sapaneṅ sira kāṭai koī binu jāgeṅ na dūri dukh hoī if dream head getting cut perceive pain wake up the incident dream illusion experience pain continues torment wake dispel illusion similarly illusion body fear experience death for enlightened soul whose illusion dispelled fear death vanishesone may ask nobody kill anyone murder considered punishable offense the answer body vehicle soul destroying living vehicle violence forbidden the vedas clearly instruct mā hinsyāt sarvabhūtāni do not commit violence toward anyone in fact vedas even consider killing animals crime however occasions rules change even violence becomes necessary for example cases snake approaching bite one attacked lethal weapons one life sustenance snatched away violence permitted selfprotection in present situation appropriate arjun violence nonviolence shree krishna explain great detail dialogue bhagavad gita progresses and course explanation priceless divine knowledge revealed shed light subject

This One is birthless, eternal, undecaying, ancient; It is not killed when the body is killed.","The eternal nature of the soul has been established in this verse, which is ever-existing and beyond birth and death. Consequently, it is devoid of the six types of transformations: asti, jāyate, vardhate, vipariṇamate, apakṣhīyate, and vinaśhyati “Existence in the womb, birth, growth, procreation, diminution, and death.” These are transformations of the body, not of the self. What we call as death is merely the destruction of the body, but the immortal self remains unaffected by all bodily changes. This concept has been repeatedly emphasized in the Vedas. The Kaṭhopaniṣhad contains a mantra almost identical to the above verse of the Bhagavad Gita:na jāyate mriyate vā vipaśhchin nāyaṁ kutaśhchin na babhūva kaśhchitajo nityaḥ śhāśhvato ’yaṁ purāṇo na hanyate hanyamāne śharīre  (1.2.18) [v25]“The soul is not born, nor does it die; it did not spring from something, and nothing sprang from it. It is unborn, eternal, immortal, and ageless. It is not destroyed when the body is destroyed.” The Bṛihadāraṇyaka Upaniṣhad states:sa vā eṣha mahān aja ātmājaro ’maro ’mṛito ’bhayaḥ  (4.4.25) [v26]“The soul is glorious, unborn, deathless, free from old age, immortal, and fearless.”",the eternal nature soul established verse everexisting beyond birth death consequently devoid six types transformations asti jāyate vardhate vipariṇamate apakṣhīyate vinaśhyati existence womb birth growth procreation diminution death these transformations body not self what call death merely destruction body immortal self remains unaffected bodily changes this concept repeatedly emphasized vedas the kaṭhopaniṣhad contains mantra almost identical verse bhagavad gita na jāyate mriyate vā vipaśhchin nāyaṁ kutaśhchin na babhūva kaśhchitajo nityaḥ śhāśhvato yaṁ purāṇo na hanyate hanyamāne śharīre the soul not born die not spring something nothing sprang it unborn eternal immortal ageless it not destroyed body destroyed the bṛihadāraṇyaka upaniṣhad states sa vā eṣha mahān aja ātmājaro maro mṛito bhayaḥ the soul glorious unborn deathless free old age immortal fearless

2,22,वासांसि जीर्णानि यथा विहाय नवानि गृह्णाति नरोऽपराणि | तथा शरीराणि विहाय जीर्णा न्यन्यानि संयाति नवानि देही ॥22॥,"As after rejecting worn-out clothes a man takes up other new ones, likewise after rejecting worn-out bodies the embodied one unites with other new ones.","Continuing to explain the nature of the soul, Shree Krishna reiterates the concept of rebirth, comparing it to an everyday activity. When garments become torn and useless, we discard them in favor of new ones, but in doing so we do not change ourselves. In the same manner, the soul remains unchanged, when it discards its worn-out body and takes birth in a new body elsewhere.The Nyāya Darśhan gives the following argument to prove the existence of rebirth:jātasya harṣhabhayaśhoka sampratipatteḥ (3.1.18) [v27]It states that if you observe a little baby, you will find it sometimes becomes happy, sometimes sad, and sometimes fearful, without any apparent reason. According to the Nyāya Darśhan, the little baby is remembering its past life, and hence experiencing these emotions. However, as it grows up, the impressions of the present life are imprinted so strongly upon its mind, that they erase most past memories. Besides, the processes of death and birth are also so painful to the soul that they erase a substantial portion of the past life’s memories.The Nyāya Darśhan gives another argument in support of rebirth: stanyābhilāṣhāt (3.1.21) [v28] It says that a newborn baby has no knowledge of language. How then can a mother teach her baby to suckle her breast when she inserts it in the baby’s mouth? However, the newborn child has drunk milk in infinite past lifetimes, even in animal forms, from the breasts, teats, and udders of innumerable mothers. Hence, when the mother puts her breast in the baby’s mouth, it automatically starts suckling based on past practice.Without accepting the concept of rebirth, the disparity between human beings becomes inexplicable and irrational. For example, let us suppose one man is blind from birth. If that person asks why he was punished in this way, what logical answer can be given to him? If we say it was a result of his karmas, he may argue that the present life is the only life he has, and therefore, there are no past karmas at the time of birth that should afflict him. If we say it was the will of God, it would also seem implausible, since God is all-merciful and would not unnecessarily want anyone to be blind. The only logical explanation is that the person was born blind as a consequence of karmas from past lives. Thus, from common sense and on the authority of the scriptures we are obliged to believe in the concept of rebirth.",continuing explain nature soul shree krishna reiterates concept rebirth comparing everyday activity when garments become torn useless discard favor new ones not change in manner soul remains unchanged discards wornout body takes birth new body elsewherethe nyāya darśhan gives following argument prove existence rebirth jātasya harṣhabhayaśhoka sampratipatteḥ it states observe little baby find sometimes becomes happy sometimes sad sometimes fearful without apparent reason according nyāya darśhan little baby remembering past life hence experiencing emotions however grows impressions present life imprinted strongly upon mind erase past memories besides processes death birth also painful soul erase substantial portion past life memoriesthe nyāya darśhan gives another argument support rebirth stanyābhilāṣhāt it says newborn baby knowledge language how mother teach baby suckle breast inserts baby mouth however newborn child drunk milk infinite past lifetimes even animal forms breasts teats udders innumerable mothers hence mother puts breast baby mouth automatically starts suckling based past practicewithout accepting concept rebirth disparity human beings becomes inexplicable irrational for example let us suppose one man blind birth if person asks punished way logical answer given if say result karmas may argue present life life therefore past karmas time birth afflict if say god would also seem implausible since god allmerciful would not unnecessarily want anyone blind the logical explanation person born blind consequence karmas past lives thus common sense authority scriptures obliged believe concept rebirth

Being subtle, the soul did not need physical space for its movement.Being subtler than the material energy, the soul is also inconceivable to our intellect. The Kaṭhopaniṣhad says:indriyebhyaḥ parā hyarthā arthebhyaśhcha paraṁ manaḥmanasastu parā buddhirbhuddherātmā mahān paraḥ (1.3.10) [v29]“Beyond the senses are the objects of the senses; subtler than the objects of the senses is the mind.

This verse needs to be understood in the context of the philosophical streams existing in India and their divergent understandings about the nature of self. Indian philosophy has historically comprised of twelve schools of thought. Six of these accept the authority of the Vedas, and hence they are called Āstik Darśhans. These are Mīmānsā, Vedānt, Nyāya, Vaiśheṣhik, Sānkhya, and Yog. Within each of these are more branches—for example, the Vedānt school of thought is further divided into six schools—Adavita vāda, Dwaita vāda, Viśhiṣhṭādvaita vāda, Viśhuddhadvaita vāda, Dwaitādvaita vāda, and Achintya-bhedābheda vāda. Each of these has further branches, for example, Advaita vāda is subdivided into Dṛiṣhṭi-sṛiṣhṭi vāda, Avachchheda vāda, Bimba-pratibimba vāda, Vivarta vāda, Ajāta vāda, etc. We will not go into the details of these schools here. Let it suffice for now to know that all these schools of thought accept the Vedas as the authority of reference. Accordingly, they all accept the eternal, unchangeable soul as the self.The remaining six schools of Indian philosophy do not accept the authority of the Vedas. These are Chārvāk vāda, the four Buddhist schools (Yogāchār vāda, Mādhyamik vāda, Vaibhāśhik vāda, and Sautāntrik vāda), and Jainism. Each of these has its own explanation for the nature of the self. Chārvāka vāda states that the body itself comprises the self, and consciousness is merely a product of the conglomeration of its constituents. Jainism states that the soul is the same size as the body, and hence, it is subject to change from birth to birth. The Buddhist schools of thought do not accept the existence of a permanent soul, and instead maintain that there is a stream of renewed animation from lifetime to lifetime, which ensures continuity of the individual.It seems that at the time of Shree Krishna too, versions of the Buddhist philosophy of renewed animation and non-permanence of the soul existed. Hence he is explaining that even if Arjun subscribes to this philosophy of renewed animation of the self from life to life, there is still no reason to lament. Why should one not lament?

Therefore, you ought not to grieve over an inevitable fact.","In English language, there is a popular idiom, “as sure as death.” Benjamin Franklin said: “The only things certain in life are death and taxes.” The most certain thing in life is that we will meet with death one day. Psychologists categorize the fear of death as the biggest fear in life. In Patanjali’s Yog Darśhan too, abhiniveśh, or the instinctive urge to survive at all costs, is mentioned as a trait of the material intellect. But for one who has taken birth, death is inevitable. So when something is inevitable, why lament over it?The Mahabharat relates an incident regarding this. During the period of their exile in the forest, one day while wandering the five Pandavas were thirsty and came across a well. Yudhishthir asked Bheem to go and fetch water for all of them. When Bheem reached the well, a yakṣha (semi-celestial being) began speaking from inside the well, “I will only let you take the water if you first answer my questions.” Bheem paid no heed and proceeded to draw water. The yakṣha pulled him in. After some time when Bheem did not return, a concerned Yudhishthir sent Arjun to see what was happening and fetch water. When Arjun reached the well, the yakṣha asked him too, “I have already seized your brother. Do not attempt to draw the water unless you can answer all my questions correctly.” Arjun also paid no heed, and the yakṣha pulled him into the well. The other brothers, Nakul and Sahadev, followed him, but met with the same fate. Finally, Yudhishthir himself came to the well. Once again, the yakṣha said, “Answer my questions if you want to drink water from the well, or I will pull you in, just as I have done to your four brothers.” Yudhisthir agreed to answer the questions. The yakṣha was actually the celestial God of death, Yamraj, in disguise. He asked sixty questions, each of which was answered perfectly by Yudhishthir. One of these questions was: kim āśhcharyaṁ? “What is the most surprising thing in this world?” Yudhisthir replied:ahany ahani bhūtāni gachchhantīha yamālayamśheṣhāḥ sthiratvam ichchhanti kimāśhcharyamataḥ param (Mahabharat) [v30]“At every moment people are dying. Those who are alive are witnessing this phenomenon, and yet they do not think that one day they will also have to die.

What lamentation can there be with regard to them?","Shree Krishna dispelled the cause of lamentation in respect to the soul in verse 2.20, and in respect to the body in verse 2.27. Now he includes both in this verse. Sage Narad instructed Yudhishthir along similar lines, in Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam:yan manyase dhruvaṁ lokam adhruvaṁ vā na chobhayamsarvathā na hi śhochyās te snehād anyatra mohajāt (1.13.44) [v31]“Whether you consider the personality to be an eternal soul or to be a temporary body, or even if you accept it as an inconceivable mixture of soul and body, you should not lament in any way. The cause for lamentation is only attachment that arises out of illusion.”In the material realm, each individual soul is bound by three bodies—gross body, subtle body, causal body.Gross body: Consists of the five gross elements of nature—earth, water, fire, air, and space.Subtle body: Consists of eighteen elements—five life-airs, five working senses, five knowledge senses, mind, intellect, and ego.Causal body: Consists of the account of karmas from endless past lives, including the sanskārs (tendencies) carried forward from previous lives.At the time of death, the soul discards its gross body, and departs with the subtle and causal bodies. God again gives the soul another gross body according to its subtle and causal bodies, and sends the soul into a suitable mother’s womb for the purpose. After the soul gives up one gross body, there is a transitional phase before it receives a new gross body. This could be a few seconds in duration or a few years long. So before birth, the soul existed with the unmanifest subtle and causal bodies. After death, it still exists in the unmanifest state. It only becomes manifest in the middle. So death is no reason for grief.",shree krishna dispelled cause lamentation respect soul verse respect body verse now includes verse sage narad instructed yudhishthir along similar lines śhrīmad bhāgavatam yan manyase dhruvaṁ lokam adhruvaṁ vā na chobhayamsarvathā na hi śhochyās te snehād anyatra mohajāt whether consider personality eternal soul temporary body even accept inconceivable mixture soul body not lament way the cause lamentation attachment arises illusion in material realm individual soul bound three body subtle body causal bodygross body consists five gross elements water fire air spacesubtle body consists eighteen lifeairs five working senses five knowledge senses mind intellect egocausal body consists account karmas endless past lives including sanskārs tendencies carried forward previous livesat time death soul discards gross body departs subtle causal bodies god gives soul another gross body according subtle causal bodies sends soul suitable mother womb purpose after soul gives one gross body transitional phase receives new gross body this could seconds duration years long so birth soul existed unmanifest subtle causal bodies after death still exists unmanifest state it becomes manifest middle so death reason grief

It is said that Anant Shesh, the divine ten thousand-headed serpent on whom Lord Vishnu resides, has been singing the glories of God since the beginning of creation, and has still not completed them.The soul, being a fragmental part of God, is more amazing than the things of the world because it is transcendental to material existence. Just as God is divine, its fragment, the soul, is also divine. For this reason, mere intellectual prowess is not enough to comprehend the soul, since the existence and nature of the soul are difficult to grasp.

There are two kinds of swa-dharmas, or prescribed duties for the individual—para dharma, or spiritual duties, and apara dharma, or material duties. Considering oneself to be the soul, the prescribed duty is to love and serve God with devotion. This is called para dharma. However, since a vast majority of humankind does not possess this spiritual perspective, the Vedas also prescribe duties for those who see themselves as the body. These duties are defined according to one’s āśhram (station in life), and varṇa (occupation). They are called apara dharma, or mundane duties. This distinction between spiritual duties and material duties needs to be kept in mind while understanding the Bhagavad Gita and the Vedic philosophy at large.By occupation, Arjun was a warrior, and so his occupational duty as a warrior was to fight for the protection of righteousness.

The occupational duties of warriors demand that they be brave and even willing to lay down their lives, if required, for the protection of society. During Vedic times, while killing animals was forbidden for the rest of society, warriors were allowed to go into the forest and practice warfare by killing animals. Such chivalrous warriors were expected to welcome the opportunity to defend righteousness with open arms. The discharge of their duty would be rewarded as a virtuous act in this life and the next.The proper discharge of one’s occupational duties is not a spiritual act in itself, and it does not result in God-realization. It is merely a virtuous deed with positive material rewards. Shree Krishna brings his instructions a step lower and says that even if Arjun is not interested in spiritual teachings, and wishes to remain at the bodily platform, then also his social duty as a warrior is to defend righteousness.As we can see, the Bhagavad Gita is a call to action, not to inaction. When people are exposed to lectures on spirituality, they often question, “Are you asking me to give up my work?” However, verse after verse, Shree Krishna is giving Arjun the reverse instruction. While Arjun wishes to abandon his duty, Shree Krishna repeatedly coaxes him to discharge it. The change that Shree Krishna wishes to see in Arjun is an internal one, in his consciousness, and not an external renunciation of works.

He had fought and overwhelmed even Lord Shiv, who had come in the disguise of a hunter. Pleased with his valor and skill, Lord Shiv had rewarded him with a celestial weapon, called Pāshupatāstra. His teacher at archery, Dronacharya, had also bestowed his blessings upon him in the form of a special weapon.

Therefore, O Arjuna, rise up with determination for fighting.","Continuing from verse 2.31, Shree Krishna is still giving instructions at the level of occupational duties. He explains to Arjun about the two possibilities arising from the performance of his duty.

2,38,सुखदु:खे समे कृत्वा लाभालाभौ जयाजयौ | ततो युद्धाय युज्यस्व नैवं पापमवाप्स्यसि ॥38॥,"Treating happiness and sorrow, gain and loss, and victory and defeat with equality, engage in battle. Thus, you will not incur sin.","Having motivated Arjun from the mundane level, Shree Krishna now moves deeper into the science of work. Arjun had expressed his fear that by killing his enemies he would incur sin. Shree Krishna addresses this apprehension. He advises Arjun to do his duty, without attachment to the fruits of his actions. Such an attitude to work will release him from any sinful reactions.When we work with selfish motives, we create karmas, which bring about their subsequent karmic reactions. The Māṭhar Śhruti states:puṇyena puṇya lokaṁ nayati pāpena pāpamubhābhyāmeva manuṣhyalokam [v34]“If you do good deeds, you will go to the celestial abodes; if you do bad deeds, you will go to the nether regions; if you do a mixture of both, you will come back to the planet Earth.” In either case, we get bound by the reactions of our karmas. Thus, mundane good deeds are also binding. They result in material rewards, which add to the stockpile of our karmas and thicken the illusion that there is happiness in the world.However, if we give up selfish motives, then our actions no longer create any karmic reactions. For example, murder is a sin, and the judicial law of every country of the world declares it to be a punishable offence. But if a policeman in the discharge of his duty kills the leader of a gang of bandits, he is not punished for it. If a soldier kills an enemy soldier in battle, he is not punished for it. In fact, he can even be awarded a medal for bravery. The reason for apparent lack of punishment is that these actions are not motivated by any ill-will or personal motive; they are performed as a matter of duty to the country. God’s law is quite similar. If one gives up all selfish motives and works merely for the sake of duty toward the Supreme, such work does not create any karmic reactions.So Shree Krishna advises Arjun to become detached from outcomes and simply focus on doing his duty. When he fights with the attitude of equanimity, treating victory and defeat, pleasure and pain as the same, then despite killing his enemies, he will never incur sin. This subject is also repeated later in the Bhagavad Gita, in verse 5.10: “Just as a lotus leaf is untouched by water, those who dedicate all their actions to God, abandoning all attachment, remain untouched by sin.”Having declared a profound conclusion about work without attachment, Shree Krishna now says that he will explain the science of work in detail, to reveal the logic behind what he has said.",having motivated arjun mundane level shree krishna moves deeper science work arjun expressed fear killing enemies would incur sin shree krishna addresses apprehension he advises arjun duty without attachment fruits actions such attitude work release sinful reactionswhen work selfish motives create karmas bring subsequent karmic reactions the māṭhar śhruti states puṇyena puṇya lokaṁ nayati pāpena pāpamubhābhyāmeva manuṣhyalokam if good deeds go celestial abodes bad deeds go nether regions mixture come back planet earth in either case get bound reactions karmas thus mundane good deeds also binding they result material rewards add stockpile karmas thicken illusion happiness worldhowever give selfish motives actions longer create karmic reactions for example murder sin judicial law every country world declares punishable offence but policeman discharge duty kills leader gang bandits not punished if soldier kills enemy soldier battle not punished in fact even awarded medal bravery the reason apparent lack punishment actions not motivated illwill personal motive performed matter duty country god law quite similar if one gives selfish motives works merely sake duty toward supreme work not create karmic reactionsso shree krishna advises arjun become detached outcomes simply focus duty when fights attitude equanimity treating victory defeat pleasure pain despite killing enemies never incur sin this subject also repeated later bhagavad gita verse just lotus leaf untouched water dedicate actions god abandoning attachment remain untouched sin having declared profound conclusion work without attachment shree krishna says explain science work detail reveal logic behind said
2,39,एषा तेऽभिहिता साङ्ख्ये बुद्धिर्योगे त्विमां शृणु | बुद्ध्या युक्तो यया पार्थ कर्मबन्धं प्रहास्यसि ॥39॥,"O Partha, this wisdom has been imparted to you from the standpoint of Self-realization. But listen to this (wisdom) from the standpoint of Yoga, endowed with which wisdom you will get rid of the bondage of action.","The word Sānkhya comes from the roots Sāṅ, meaning “complete,” and khyā, meaning “to know.” So Sānkhya means the “complete analytical knowledge of something.” The Sankhya Darshan, which is one of the six philosophical treatises in Indian philosophy, makes an analytical enumeration of the entities in cosmos. It lists twenty-four entities: pañch-mahābhūta (earth, water, fire, air, and sky), pañch tanmātrā (the five abstract qualities of matter—taste, touch, smell, sound, and sight), pañch karmendriya (five working senses), pañch jñānendriya (five knowledge senses), mind, ahankār (the entity created by the evolution of mahān), mahān (the entity created by evolution of prakṛiti), prakṛiti (the primordial form of the material energy). Apart from these is puruṣh or the soul, which tries to enjoy prakṛiti, and gets bound in it.Shree Krishna has just explained to Arjun another form of Sānkhya, which is the analytical knowledge of the immortal soul. He now says that he is going to reveal the science of working without desire for rewards. This requires detachment from the fruits of actions. Such detachment comes by practicing discrimination with the intellect. Hence, Shree Krishna has interestingly called it buddhi yog, or “Yog of the Intellect.” In subsequent verses (2.41 and 2.44), he goes on to explain how the intellect plays an important role in bringing the mind to a state of detachment.",the word sānkhya comes roots sāṅ meaning complete khyā meaning know so sānkhya means complete analytical knowledge something the sankhya darshan one six philosophical treatises indian philosophy makes analytical enumeration entities cosmos it lists twentyfour entities pañchmahābhūta earth water fire air sky pañch tanmātrā five abstract qualities touch smell sound sight pañch karmendriya five working senses pañch jñānendriya five knowledge senses mind ahankār entity created evolution mahān mahān entity created evolution prakṛiti prakṛiti primordial form material energy apart puruṣh soul tries enjoy prakṛiti gets bound itshree krishna explained arjun another form sānkhya analytical knowledge immortal soul he says going reveal science working without desire rewards this requires detachment fruits actions such detachment comes practicing discrimination intellect hence shree krishna interestingly called buddhi yog yog intellect in subsequent verses goes explain intellect plays important role bringing mind state detachment
2,40,नेहाभिक्रमनाशोऽस्ति प्रत्यवायो न विद्यते | स्वल्पमप्यस्य धर्मस्य त्रायते महतो भयात् ॥40॥,Here there is no waste of an attempt; nor is there (any) harm. Even a little of this righteousness saves (one) from great fear.,"The great danger we face is that we may not get the human form in the next life, and instead go into the lower species of life, such as animals, birds, the nether regions, etc. We cannot be complacent that the human form will remain reserved for us, for the next birth will be determined by our karmas and level of consciousness in this life.There are 8.4 million species of life in existence. The species below human beings—animals, birds, fishes, insects, birds, etc.—do not have an evolved intellect as we humans do. Yet, they also perform commonplace activities such as eating, sleeping, defending, and mating. Human beings have been endowed with the faculty of knowledge, for a higher purpose, so that they may utilize it to elevate themselves. If humans utilize their intellects merely for doing the animalistic activities of eating, sleeping, mating, and defending, in a deluxe way, it is a misuse of the human form. For example, if someone makes eating as the primary pleasure of life, then the body of a pig becomes more suitable for such a person, and thus, that individual receives a pig’s body in the next life. If someone makes sleeping the goal of life, then God deems that the body of a polar bear is more suitable for such activity and allots it in the succeeding life. So the great danger before us is that we may not get a human birth in the next life. The Vedas state:iha chedavedīdatha satyamasti na chedihāvedīnmahatī vinaṣhṭhiḥ(Kenopaniṣhad 2.5) [v35]“O human being, the human birth is a rare opportunity. If you do not utilize it to achieve your goal, you will suffer great ruin.” Again, they state:iha chedaśhakad boddhuṁ prākśharīrasya visrasaḥtataḥ sargeṣhu lokeṣhu śharīratvāya kalpate (Kaṭhopaniṣhad 2.3.4) [v36]“If you do not strive for God-realization in this life, you will continue to rotate in the 8.4 million species of life for many births.”However, once we commence on the journey of spiritual practice then even if we do not complete the path in this life, God sees that our intention to do so existed. Therefore, he grants us the human birth again, to enable us to continue from where we had left off. In this way, we avert the great danger.Also, Shree Krishna says that no loss ever comes from endeavor made on this path. This is because whatever material assets we accumulate in the present life have to be left behind at the time of death. But if we make any spiritual advancement on the path of Yog, God preserves it, and gives us the fruits in the next life, enabling us to start off from where we had left. Thus, having informed Arjun about its benefits, Shree Krishna now begins instructing him about the science of working without attachment.",the great danger face may not get human form next life instead go lower species life animals birds nether regions etc we not complacent human form remain reserved us next birth determined karmas level consciousness lifethere million species life existence the species human birds fishes insects birds not evolved intellect humans yet also perform commonplace activities eating sleeping defending mating human beings endowed faculty knowledge higher purpose may utilize elevate if humans utilize intellects merely animalistic activities eating sleeping mating defending deluxe way misuse human form for example someone makes eating primary pleasure life body pig becomes suitable person thus individual receives pig body next life if someone makes sleeping goal life god deems body polar bear suitable activity allots succeeding life so great danger us may not get human birth next life the vedas state iha chedavedīdatha satyamasti na chedihāvedīnmahatī vinaṣhṭhiḥ kenopaniṣhad o human human birth rare opportunity if not utilize achieve goal suffer great ruin again state iha chedaśhakad boddhuṁ prākśharīrasya visrasaḥtataḥ sargeṣhu lokeṣhu śharīratvāya kalpate kaṭhopaniṣhad if not strive godrealization life continue rotate million species life many births however commence journey spiritual practice even not complete path life god sees intention existed therefore grants us human birth enable us continue left in way avert great dangeralso shree krishna says loss ever comes endeavor made path this whatever material assets accumulate present life left behind time death but make spiritual advancement path yog god preserves gives us fruits next life enabling us start left thus informed arjun benefits shree krishna begins instructing science working without attachment
2,41,व्यवसायात्मिका बुद्धिरेकेह कुरुनन्दन | बहुशाखा ह्यनन्ताश्च बुद्धयोऽव्यवसायिनाम् ॥41॥,"O scion of the Kuru dynasty, in this there is a single, one-pointed conviction. The thoughts of the irresolute ones have many branches indeed, and are innumerable.","Attachment is a function of the mind. Its manifestation is that the mind repeatedly runs toward the object of its attachment, which could be persons, sensual objects, prestige, bodily comfort, situations, and so on. So if thoughts of some person or object repeatedly come to the mind, it is a possible indication of the mind being attached to it. However, if it is the mind that gets attached, then why is Shree Krishna bringing the intellect into the topic of attachment? Is there any role of the intellect in eliminating attachment?Within our body is the subtle antaḥ karaṇ, which we also colloquially refer to as the heart. It consists of the mind, the intellect, and the ego. In this subtle machine, the intellect is superior to the mind. It makes decisions while the mind creates desires and gets attached to the object of affection as determined by the intellect. For instance, if the intellect decides that money is the source of happiness, the mind hankers for wealth. If the intellect decides that prestige is the most important thing in life, the mind craves for reputation and fame. In other words, the mind develops desires in accordance with the knowledge of the intellect.Throughout the day, we humans control our mind with the intellect. While sitting at home, we adopt informal postures in which the mind finds comfort. Yet, we adopt appropriate formal postures while sitting in the office. It is not that the mind enjoys the formality of the office—given its way, it would rather embrace the informality of home. However, the intellect decides that formal behavior is necessary in the office. So the intellect controls the mind, and people sit formally all day long, following the decorum of the workplace, against the nature of the mind. Similarly, the mind does not enjoy doing office work—if it had its way, it would rather sit at home and watch television. But the intellect rules that working in office is necessary to earn a living. Therefore, the intellect again reins in the natural tendency of the mind, and people work eight hours a day, or longer.The above examples illustrate that as human beings our intellect possesses the ability to control the mind. Thus, we must cultivate the intellect with proper knowledge and use it to guide the mind in the proper direction. Buddhi yog is the art of detaching the mind from the fruits of actions, by developing a resolute decision of the intellect that all work is meant for the pleasure of God. Such a person of resolute intellect cultivates single-minded focus on the goal, and traverses the path like an arrow released from the bow. This resolve becomes so strong in higher stages of sādhanā that nothing can deter the sādhak from treading the path. He or she thinks, “Even if there are millions of obstacles on my path, even if the whole world condemns me, even if I have to lay down my life, I will still not give up my sādhanā.” But those whose intellect is many-branched find their mind running in various directions. They are unable to develop the focus of mind that is required to tread the path to God.",attachment function mind its manifestation mind repeatedly runs toward object attachment could persons sensual objects prestige bodily comfort situations so thoughts person object repeatedly come mind possible indication mind attached however mind gets attached shree krishna bringing intellect topic attachment is role intellect eliminating attachment within body subtle antaḥ karaṇ also colloquially refer heart it consists mind intellect ego in subtle machine intellect superior mind it makes decisions mind creates desires gets attached object affection determined intellect for instance intellect decides money source happiness mind hankers wealth if intellect decides prestige important thing life mind craves reputation fame in words mind develops desires accordance knowledge intellectthroughout day humans control mind intellect while sitting home adopt informal postures mind finds comfort yet adopt appropriate formal postures sitting office it not mind enjoys formality way would rather embrace informality home however intellect decides formal behavior necessary office so intellect controls mind people sit formally day long following decorum workplace nature mind similarly mind not enjoy office way would rather sit home watch television but intellect rules working office necessary earn living therefore intellect reins natural tendency mind people work eight hours day longerthe examples illustrate human beings intellect possesses ability control mind thus must cultivate intellect proper knowledge use guide mind proper direction buddhi yog art detaching mind fruits actions developing resolute decision intellect work meant pleasure god such person resolute intellect cultivates singleminded focus goal traverses path like arrow released bow this resolve becomes strong higher stages sādhanā nothing deter sādhak treading path he thinks even millions obstacles path even whole world condemns even i lay life i still not give sādhanā but whose intellect manybranched find mind running various directions they unable develop focus mind required tread path god

These modes of material nature are sattva (mode of goodness), rajas (mode of passion), and tamas (mode of ignorance). The relative proportion of the three modes varies for every individual, due their sanskārs (tendencies) from countless past lives, and accordingly, everyone has different inclinations and tendencies. The Vedic scriptures accept this disparity and give suitable instructions for all kinds of people. If the śhāstras did not contain instructions for worldly-minded people, they would have gone further astray. So, the Vedas offer them material rewards for the performance of rigorous rituals, helping them rise from the mode of ignorance to passion, and from passion to goodness.Thus, the Vedas contain both kinds of knowledge—ritualistic ceremonies for the materially attached and divine knowledge for spiritual aspirants. When Shree Krishna tells Arjun to reject the Vedas, the statement needs to be understood in the context of the preceding and following verses. He is implying that Arjun should not be attracted by the section of the Vedas that propounds rules, regulations, and ceremonies for material rewards. Instead, he should use the divine section of the Vedic knowledge to elevate himself to the level of Absolute Truth.",the material energy binds divine soul bodily conception life three constituent modes these modes material nature sattva mode goodness rajas mode passion tamas mode ignorance the relative proportion three modes varies every individual due sanskārs tendencies countless past lives accordingly everyone different inclinations tendencies the vedic scriptures accept disparity give suitable instructions kinds people if śhāstras not contain instructions worldlyminded people would gone astray so vedas offer material rewards performance rigorous rituals helping rise mode ignorance passion passion goodnessthus vedas contain kinds ceremonies materially attached divine knowledge spiritual aspirants when shree krishna tells arjun reject vedas statement needs understood context preceding following verses he implying arjun not attracted section vedas propounds rules regulations ceremonies material rewards instead use divine section vedic knowledge elevate level absolute truth

The underlying motive is to help the soul gradually get detached from the world and attached to God. Thus, one who is attaching the mind to God is automatically fulfilling the purpose of all the Vedic mantras. Shree Krishna advises Uddhav:ājñāyaivaṁ guṇān doṣhān mayādiṣhṭān api swakāndharmān santyajya yaḥ sarvān māṁ bhajeta sa sattamaḥ (Bhāgavatam 11.11.32)[v39]“The Vedas prescribe varieties of social and ritualistic duties for individuals.

2,47,कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन | मा कर्मफलहेतुर्भूर्मा ते सङ्गोऽस्त्वकर्मणि || 47 ||,"Your right is for action alone, never for the results. Do not become the agent of the results of action. May you not have any inclination for inaction.","This is an extremely popular verse of the Bhagavad Gita, so much so that even most school children in India are familiar with it. It offers deep insight into the proper spirit of work and is often quoted whenever the topic of karm yog is discussed. The verse gives four instructions regarding the science of work: 1) Do your duty, but do not concern yourself with the results. 2) The fruits of your actions are not for your enjoyment. 3) Even while working, give up the pride of doership. 4) Do not be attached to inaction.Do your duty, but do not concern yourself with the results. We have the right to do our duty, but the results are not dependent only upon our efforts. A number of factors come into play in determining the results—our efforts, destiny (our past karmas), the will of God, the efforts of others, the cumulative karmas of the people involved, the place and situation (a matter of luck), etc. Now if we become anxious for results, we will experience anxiety whenever they are not according to our expectations. So Shree Krishna advises Arjun to give up concern for the results and instead focus solely on doing a good job. The fact is that when we are unconcerned about the results, we are able to focus entirely on our efforts, and the result is even better than before.A humorous acronym for this is NATO or Not Attached to Outcome. Consider its application to a simple everyday activity such as playing golf. When people play golf, they are engrossed in the fruits—whether their score is under par, over par, etc. Now if they could merely focus on playing the shots to the best of their ability, they would find it the most enjoyable game of golf they have ever played. Additionally, with their complete focus on the shot being played, their game would be raised to a higher level.The fruits of your actions are not for your enjoyment. To perform actions is an integral part of human nature. Having come into this world, we all have various duties determined by our family situation, social position, occupation, etc. While performing these actions, we must remember that we are not the enjoyers of the results—the results are meant for the pleasure of God. The individual soul is a tiny part of God (verse 15.7), and hence our inherent nature is to serve him through all our actions.dāsa bhūtamidaṁ tasya jagatsthāvara jangamamśhrīmannārāyaṇa swāmī jagatāṁprabhurīśhwaraḥ (Padma Puran)[v40]“God is the Master of the entire creation; all moving and non-moving beings are his servants.” Material consciousness is characterized by the following manner of thoughts, “I am the proprietor of all that I possess. It is all meant for my enjoyment. I have the right to enhance my possessions and maximize my enjoyment.” The reverse of this is Spiritual consciousness, which is characterized by thoughts such as, “God is the owner and enjoyer of this entire world. I am merely his selfless servant. I must use all that I have in the service of God.” Accordingly, Shree Krishna instructs Arjun not to think of himself as the enjoyer of the fruits of his actions.Even while working, give up the pride of doership. Shree Krishna wants Arjun to give up kartritwābhimān, or the ego of being the doer. He instructs Arjun never to chase after preconceived motives attached to his actions nor consider himself as the cause of the results of his actions. However, when we perform actions, then why should we not consider ourselves as the doers of those actions? The reason is that our senses, mind, and intellect are inert; God energizes them with his power and puts them at our disposal. As a result, only with the help of the power we receive from him, are we able to work. For example, the tongs in the kitchen are inactive by themselves, but they get energized by someone’s hand, and then they perform even difficult tasks, such as lifting burning coal, etc. Now if we say that the tongs are the doers of actions, it will be inaccurate. If the hand did not energize them, what would they be able to do? They would merely lie inert on the table. Similarly, if God did not supply our body-mind-soul mechanism with the power to perform actions, we could have done nothing. Thus, we must give up the ego of doing, remembering that God is the only source of the power by which we perform all our actions.All the above thoughts are very nicely summarized in the following popular Sanskrit verse:yatkṛitaṁ yatkariṣhyāmi tatsarvaṁ na mayā kṛitamtvayā kṛitaṁ tu phalabhuk tvameva madhusūdana [v41]“Whatever I have achieved and whatever I wish to achieve, I am not the doer of these. O Madhusudan, you are the real doer, and you alone are the enjoyer of their results.”Do not be attached to inaction. Although the nature of the living being is to work, often situations arise where work seems burdensome and confusing. In such cases, instead of running away from it, we must understand and implement the proper science of work, as explained by Shree Krishna to Arjun. However, it is highly inappropriate if we consider work as laborious and burdensome, and resort to inaction. Becoming attached to inaction is never the solution and is clearly condemned by Shree Krishna.",this extremely popular verse bhagavad gita much even school children india familiar it offers deep insight proper spirit work often quoted whenever topic karm yog discussed the verse gives four instructions regarding science work do duty not concern results the fruits actions not enjoyment even working give pride doership do not attached inactiondo duty not concern results we right duty results not dependent upon efforts a number factors come play determining efforts destiny past karmas god efforts others cumulative karmas people involved place situation matter luck etc now become anxious results experience anxiety whenever not according expectations so shree krishna advises arjun give concern results instead focus solely good job the fact unconcerned results able focus entirely efforts result even better beforea humorous acronym nato not attached outcome consider application simple everyday activity playing golf when people play golf engrossed score par par etc now could merely focus playing shots best ability would find enjoyable game golf ever played additionally complete focus shot played game would raised higher levelthe fruits actions not enjoyment to perform actions integral part human nature having come world various duties determined family situation social position occupation etc while performing actions must remember not enjoyers results meant pleasure god the individual soul tiny part god verse hence inherent nature serve actionsdāsa bhūtamidaṁ tasya jagatsthāvara jangamamśhrīmannārāyaṇa swāmī jagatāṁprabhurīśhwaraḥ padma puran god master entire creation moving nonmoving beings servants material consciousness characterized following manner thoughts i proprietor i possess it meant enjoyment i right enhance possessions maximize enjoyment the reverse spiritual consciousness characterized thoughts god owner enjoyer entire world i merely selfless servant i must use i service god accordingly shree krishna instructs arjun not think enjoyer fruits actionseven working give pride doership shree krishna wants arjun give kartritwābhimān ego doer he instructs arjun never chase preconceived motives attached actions consider cause results actions however perform actions not consider doers actions the reason senses mind intellect inert god energizes power puts disposal as result help power receive able work for example tongs kitchen inactive get energized someone hand perform even difficult tasks lifting burning coal etc now say tongs doers actions inaccurate if hand not energize would able they would merely lie inert table similarly god not supply bodymindsoul mechanism power perform actions could done nothing thus must give ego remembering god source power perform actionsall thoughts nicely summarized following popular sanskrit verse yatkṛitaṁ yatkariṣhyāmi tatsarvaṁ na mayā kṛitamtvayā kṛitaṁ tu phalabhuk tvameva madhusūdana whatever i achieved whatever i wish achieve i not doer o madhusudan real doer alone enjoyer results do not attached inaction although nature living work often situations arise work seems burdensome confusing in cases instead running away must understand implement proper science work explained shree krishna arjun however highly inappropriate consider work laborious burdensome resort inaction becoming attached inaction never solution clearly condemned shree krishna
2,48,योगस्थ: कुरु कर्माणि सङ्गं त्यक्त्वा धनञ्जय | सिद्ध्यसिद्ध्यो: समो भूत्वा समत्वं योग उच्यते ॥48॥,"By being established in Yoga, O Dhananjaya (Arjuna), undertake actions, casting off attachment and remaining equipoised in success and failure. Evenness of mind is called Yoga.","The equanimity that enables us to accept all circumstances with serenity is so praiseworthy that Shree Krishna calls it Yog, or union with the Supreme. This equipoise comes from implementing the knowledge of the previous verse. When we understand that the effort is in our hands, not the results, we then concern ourselves only with doing our duty. The results are for the pleasure of God, and so we dedicate them to him. Now, if the results are not to our expectations, we calmly accept them as the will of God. In this way, we are able to accept fame and infamy, success and failure, pleasure and pain, as God’s will, and when we learn to embrace both equally, we develop the equanimity that Shree Krishna talks about.The verse is a very practical solution to the vicissitudes of life. If we are sailing in the ocean in a boat, it is natural to expect the waves of the ocean to shake the boat. If we get disturbed each time a wave rocks the boat, our miseries would be endless. And if we do not expect the waves to arise, we would be expecting the ocean to become something other than its natural self. Waves are an inseparable phenomenon of the ocean. Similarly, as we wade through the ocean of life, it throws up all kinds of waves that are beyond our control. If we keep struggling to eliminate negative situations, we will be unable to avoid unhappiness. But if we can learn to accept everything that comes our way, without sacrificing our best efforts, we will have surrendered to the will of God, and that will be true Yog.",the equanimity enables us accept circumstances serenity praiseworthy shree krishna calls yog union supreme this equipoise comes implementing knowledge previous verse when understand effort hands not results concern duty the results pleasure god dedicate now results not expectations calmly accept god in way able accept fame infamy success failure pleasure pain god learn embrace equally develop equanimity shree krishna talks aboutthe verse practical solution vicissitudes life if sailing ocean boat natural expect waves ocean shake boat if get disturbed time wave rocks boat miseries would endless and not expect waves arise would expecting ocean become something natural self waves inseparable phenomenon ocean similarly wade ocean life throws kinds waves beyond control if keep struggling eliminate negative situations unable avoid unhappiness but learn accept everything comes way without sacrificing best efforts surrendered god true yog
2,49,दूरेण ह्यवरं कर्म बुद्धियोगाद्धनञ्जय | बुद्धौ शरणमन्विच्छ कृपणा: फलहेतव: ॥49॥,"O Dhananjaya, indeed, action with a self-motive is far inferior to the yoga of wisdom. Take resort to wisdom. Those who thirst for rewards are pitiable.","There are two aspects to work: 1) The external activity we do, 2) Our internal attitude toward it. For example, let us say that a temple is being built in the holy land of Vrindavan. The workers are engaged in a sacred activity, but their attitude is mundane. They are concerned with the salary they receive. If another contractor offers higher wages, they will not mind switching their job. There is also an ascetic living in Vrindavan, who, seeing the glorious temple being built, engages in kār sevā (voluntary work) as a service to God. The external work performed by the sadhu and the workers are the same, but the internal attitudes are poles apart.Here Shree Krishna advises Arjun to move higher in his internal motivation toward work. He declares that those who work with the motivation of self-enjoyment are miserly. Those who are detached from the fruits and dedicate their work to a higher cause are superior. And those who offer the fruits to God are truly in knowledge.The word kṛipaṇa (miserly) has been used here. The Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam describes a kṛipaṇa:na veda kṛipaṇaḥ śhreya ātmano guṇa-vastu-dṛiktasya tān ichchhato yachchhed yadi so ’pi tathā-vidhaḥ (6.9.49)[v42]“Kṛipaṇa are those who think that the ultimate reality consists only of sense objects produced from the material energy.” Again, the Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam, states: kṛipaṇo yo ’jitendriyaḥ (11.19.44)[v43] “A kṛipaṇa is one who has no control over the senses.”As an individual evolves to higher levels of consciousness, one naturally sheds the desire for enjoying the fruits of work, and moves in the direction of service. Bill Gates, having renounced his position in Microsoft Corporation, now dedicates his energy in the service of society. Similarly, after having had his fill of power and position as the President of USA, Bill Clinton now preaches the glories of service to humankind, and has even written a book on the topic, “Giving—How Each Of Us Can Change The World.” Their engagement in service is praiseworthy, but it is still imperfectly oriented. That service attitude becomes perfect when we learn to do our works for the pleasure of God, dedicating all the fruits to him.",there two aspects work the external activity our internal attitude toward for example let us say temple built holy land vrindavan the workers engaged sacred activity attitude mundane they concerned salary receive if another contractor offers higher wages not mind switching job there also ascetic living vrindavan seeing glorious temple built engages kār sevā voluntary work service god the external work performed sadhu workers internal attitudes poles aparthere shree krishna advises arjun move higher internal motivation toward work he declares work motivation selfenjoyment miserly those detached fruits dedicate work higher cause superior and offer fruits god truly knowledgethe word kṛipaṇa miserly used the śhrīmad bhāgavatam describes kṛipaṇa na veda kṛipaṇaḥ śhreya ātmano guṇavastudṛiktasya tān ichchhato yachchhed yadi pi tathāvidhaḥ kṛipaṇa think ultimate reality consists sense objects produced material energy again śhrīmad bhāgavatam states kṛipaṇo yo jitendriyaḥ a kṛipaṇa one control senses as individual evolves higher levels consciousness one naturally sheds desire enjoying fruits work moves direction service bill gates renounced position microsoft corporation dedicates energy service society similarly fill power position president usa bill clinton preaches glories service humankind even written book topic each of us can change the world their engagement service praiseworthy still imperfectly oriented that service attitude becomes perfect learn works pleasure god dedicating fruits
2,50,बुद्धियुक्तो जहातीह उभे सुकृतदुष्कृते | तस्माद्योगाय युज्यस्व योग: कर्मसु कौशलम् ॥50॥,"Possessed of wisdom, one rejects here both virtue and vice. Therefore, devote yourself to (Karma-) yoga. Yoga is skilfulness in action.","Upon hearing the science of karm-yog, people often wonder that if they give up attachment to results, will their performance go down? Shree Krishna explains that working without personal motivation does not reduce the quality of our work; instead we become even more skillful than before. Consider the example of a sincere surgeon who cuts people with his knife while operating upon them. He performs his duty with equanimity, and is undisturbed irrespective of whether the patient survives or dies. This is because he is merely doing his duty unselfishly, to the best of his ability, and is not attached to the results. Hence, even if the patient dies while being operated upon, the surgeon does not feel guilty of murder. However, if the same surgeon’s only child needs to be operated, he does not have the courage to do so. Because of attachment to the results, he fears he will not be able to perform the operation skillfully, and so he seeks the help of another surgeon. This shows that attachment to results does not make us more skillful; rather, the attachment affects our performance adversely. Instead, if we work without attachment, we can do so at our maximum skill level, without feeling nervous, jittery, scared, tense, or excited.Likewise, Arjun’s personal example also illustrates the point that giving up attachment to the fruits does not adversely affect performance. Before hearing the Bhagavad Gita, he intended to engage in war with the desire of winning a kingdom. After hearing the Bhagavad Gita from Shree Krishna, he was fighting because it was his duty to God, and Shree Krishna would be pleased by it. He was still a warrior; however, his internal motivation had changed. The fact that he did his duty without attachment did not make him any less competent than before. In fact, he fought with greater inspiration because his work was directly in service of God.",upon hearing science karmyog people often wonder give attachment results performance go shree krishna explains working without personal motivation not reduce quality work instead become even skillful consider example sincere surgeon cuts people knife operating upon he performs duty equanimity undisturbed irrespective whether patient survives dies this merely duty unselfishly best ability not attached results hence even patient dies operated upon surgeon not feel guilty murder however surgeon child needs operated not courage because attachment results fears not able perform operation skillfully seeks help another surgeon this shows attachment results not make us skillful rather attachment affects performance adversely instead work without attachment maximum skill level without feeling nervous jittery scared tense excitedlikewise arjun personal example also illustrates point giving attachment fruits not adversely affect performance before hearing bhagavad gita intended engage war desire winning kingdom after hearing bhagavad gita shree krishna fighting duty god shree krishna would pleased he still warrior however internal motivation changed the fact duty without attachment not make less competent in fact fought greater inspiration work directly service god

The paradox of life is that we strive for happiness, but reap misery; we crave love, but we meet with disappointment; we covet life, but know we are moving toward death at every moment. The Bhāgavatam states:sukhāya karmāṇi karoti loko na taiḥ sukhaṁ vānyad-upāramaṁ vāvindeta bhūyas tata eva duḥkhaṁ yad atra yuktaṁ bhagavān vaden naḥ (3.5.2)[v44]“Every human being engages in fruitive works to get happiness, but finds no satisfaction. Instead, these activities only aggravate the misery.” As a result, practically everyone in this world is unhappy. Some suffer from the miseries of their own body and mind; others are tormented by their family members and relatives; some suffer from scarcity of wealth and the paucity of the necessities of life. Materially minded people know they are unhappy, but they think that others ahead of them must be happy, and so they continue running in the direction of material growth. This blind pursuit has been going on for many lifetimes and yet there is no sight of happiness. Now, if people could realize that nobody has ever achieved happiness by engaging in fruitive works, they would then understand that the direction in which they are running is futile, and they would think of doing a U-turn toward spiritual life.Those whose intellects have become steadfast with spiritual knowledge understand that God is the Supreme Enjoyer of everything. Consequently, they renounce attachment to the fruits of their actions, offer everything to him, and serenely accept everything that comes as his prasād (mercy). In doing so, their actions become free from karmic reactions that bind one to the cycle of life and death.",shree krishna continues expound topic working without attachment fruits actions states leads one state beyond suffering the paradox life strive happiness reap misery crave love meet disappointment covet life know moving toward death every moment the bhāgavatam states sukhāya karmāṇi karoti loko na taiḥ sukhaṁ vānyadupāramaṁ vāvindeta bhūyas tata eva duḥkhaṁ yad atra yuktaṁ bhagavān vaden naḥ every human engages fruitive works get happiness finds satisfaction instead activities aggravate misery as result practically everyone world unhappy some suffer miseries body mind others tormented family members relatives suffer scarcity wealth paucity necessities life materially minded people know unhappy think others ahead must happy continue running direction material growth this blind pursuit going many lifetimes yet sight happiness now people could realize nobody ever achieved happiness engaging fruitive works would understand direction running futile would think uturn toward spiritual lifethose whose intellects become steadfast spiritual knowledge understand god supreme enjoyer everything consequently renounce attachment fruits actions offer everything serenely accept everything comes prasād mercy in actions become free karmic reactions bind one cycle life death

However, one whose intellect is illumined with spiritual knowledge no longer seeks material sense pleasures, knowing them to be harbingers of misery. Such a person then loses interest in Vedic rituals. The Muṇḍakopaniṣhad states:parīkṣhya lokānkarmachitānbrāhmaṇo nirvedamāyānnāstyakṛitaḥ kṛitena (1.2.12)[v45]“Realized sages go beyond Vedic rituals, after understanding that the pleasures one attains from fruitive karmas, in this life and in the celestial abodes, are temporary and mixed with misery.”",shree krishna previously said people attached worldly enjoyment get attracted flowery words vedas propagate ostentatious rituals gaining worldly opulences attaining celestial abodes verses however one whose intellect illumined spiritual knowledge longer seeks material sense pleasures knowing harbingers misery such person loses interest vedic rituals the muṇḍakopaniṣhad states parīkṣhya lokānkarmachitānbrāhmaṇo nirvedamāyānnāstyakṛitaḥ kṛitena realized sages go beyond vedic rituals understanding pleasures one attains fruitive karmas life celestial abodes temporary mixed misery

At that time, they find the Vedic rituals they were previously performing to be cumbersome and time consuming. They then wonder whether they are obliged to keep performing the rituals, along with their devotion, and if they reject the ritual and dedicate themselves fully to their sādhanā, will they be committing an offense? Such people will find the answer to their doubt in this verse. Shree Krishna says that to be fixed in sādhanā without being allured to the fruitive sections of the Vedas is not an offence; rather, it is a higher spiritual state.Madhavendra Puri, the famous 14th century sage, states this sentiment very emphatically. He was a Vedic Brahmin and used to engage in extensive ritualistic practices, but then took to sanyās (the renounced order), and engaged wholeheartedly in devotion to Shree Krishna. In his later life, he wrote:sandhyā vandana bhadramastu bhavate bhoḥ snāna tubhyaṁ namaḥbho devāḥ pitaraśhchatarapaṇa vidhau nahaṁ kṣhamaḥ kṣhamyatāmyatra kvāpi niṣhadya yādava kulottaasya kansadviṣhaḥsmāraṁ smāramaghaṁ harāmi tadalaṁ manye kimanyena me [v46]“I wish to apologize to all kinds of rituals as I have no time to respect them. So dear Sandhyā Vandan (a set of rituals performed thrice daily by those who have received the sacred thread), holy baths, sacrifices to the celestial gods, offerings to the ancestors, etc. please excuse me. Now, wherever I sit, I remember the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna, the enemy of Kansa, and that is sufficient to release me from material bondage.”Shree Krishna uses the word samādhāv-achalā in this verse, to refer to the state of steadfastness in divine consciousness. The word Samādhi has been formed from the roots sam (equilibrium) and dhi (intellect), meaning, “a state of total equilibrium of the intellect.” One who is steadfast in the higher consciousness, unmoved by material allurements attains that state of Samādhi, or perfect Yog.",as sādhaks advance spiritual path within minds relationship god becomes stronger at time find vedic rituals previously performing cumbersome time consuming they wonder whether obliged keep performing rituals along devotion reject ritual dedicate fully sādhanā committing offense such people find answer doubt verse shree krishna says fixed sādhanā without allured fruitive sections vedas not offence rather higher spiritual statemadhavendra puri famous century sage states sentiment emphatically he vedic brahmin used engage extensive ritualistic practices took sanyās renounced order engaged wholeheartedly devotion shree krishna in later life wrote sandhyā vandana bhadramastu bhavate bhoḥ snāna tubhyaṁ namaḥbho devāḥ pitaraśhchatarapaṇa vidhau nahaṁ kṣhamaḥ kṣhamyatāmyatra kvāpi niṣhadya yādava kulottaasya kansadviṣhaḥsmāraṁ smāramaghaṁ harāmi tadalaṁ manye kimanyena i wish apologize kinds rituals i time respect so dear sandhyā vandan set rituals performed thrice daily received sacred thread holy baths sacrifices celestial gods offerings ancestors etc please excuse now wherever i sit i remember supreme lord shree krishna enemy kansa sufficient release material bondage shree krishna uses word samādhāvachalā verse refer state steadfastness divine consciousness the word samādhi formed roots sam equilibrium dhi intellect meaning state total equilibrium intellect one steadfast higher consciousness unmoved material allurements attains state samādhi perfect yog

Additionally he wishes to know how this divine state of mind manifests in a person’s behavior.Beginning with this verse, Arjun asks Shree Krishna sixteen sets of questions. In response, Shree Krishna reveals the deepest secrets of karm yog, jñāna yog, bhakti yog, austerity, meditation, etc. The sixteen sets of questions asked by Arjun are:1. “What is the disposition of one who is situated in divine consciousness? (verse 2.54)2. “If you consider knowledge superior to fruitive works, then why do you ask me to wage this terrible war?” (verse 3.1)3. “Why is a person impelled to commit sinful acts, even unwillingly, as if by force?” (verse 3.36)4. “You were born much after Vivasvan.

Please tell me decisively which of the two is more beneficial?” (verse 5.1)6. “O Krishna, the mind is very restless, turbulent, strong and obstinate. It appears to me that it is more difficult to control than the wind.” (verse 6.34)7. “What is the fate of the unsuccessful yogi who begins the path with faith, but whose mind deviates from God due to untamed passions, and is unable to reach the highest perfection in this life?” (verse 6.37)8. “What is Brahman and what is karma?

Each fragment is naturally drawn towards its whole; just as a piece of stone is drawn by the force of gravitation towards the earth. The individual soul is a fragment of God, who is infinite bliss. Hence, the soul is a fragment of the ocean of infinite bliss, and it experiences the natural urge for bliss. When it strives to relish the bliss of the soul from God, it is called “Divine Love.” But when, in ignorance of its spiritual nature, it thinks of itself as the body, and seeks to relish the bliss of the body from the world, it is called “lust.”This world has been called mṛiga tṛiṣhṇā in the scriptures, meaning “like the mirage seen by the deer.” The sun rays reflecting on the hot desert sand create an illusion of water for the deer. It thinks there is water ahead of it and runs to quench its thirst. But the more it runs toward the water, the more the mirage fades away. Its dull intellect cannot recognize that it is running after an illusion. The unfortunate deer keeps chasing the illusory water and dies of exhaustion on the desert sand. Similarly, the material energy Maya too creates an illusion of happiness, and we run after that illusory happiness in the hope of quenching the thirst of our senses. But no matter how much we try, happiness keeps fading further away from us. The Garuḍ Purāṇ states:chakradharo ’pi suratvaṁ suratvalābhe sakalasurapatitvambhavtirum surapatirūrdhvagatitvaṁ tathāpi nanivartate tṛiṣhṇā (2.12.14) [v47]“A king wishes to be the emperor of the whole world; the emperor aspires to be a celestial god; a celestial god seeks to be Indra, the king of heaven; and Indra desires to be Brahma, the secondary creator. Yet the thirst for material enjoyment does not get satiated.”But when one learns to turn the mind away from material allurements and renounces the desires of the senses, such a person comes in touch with the inner bliss of the soul and becomes transcendentally situated. The Kaṭhopaniṣhad goes to the extent of saying that one who has renounced desires becomes like God:yadā sarve pramuchyante kāmā ye ’sya hṛidi śhritaḥatha martyo ’mṛito bhavatyatra brahma samaśhnute (2.3.14)[v48]“When one eliminates all selfish desires from the heart, then the materially fettered jīvātmā (soul) attains freedom from birth and death, and becomes Godlike in virtue.” Shree Krishna states in the above verse that a transcendentally situated person is one who has given up selfish desires and cravings of the senses, and is satisfied in the self.",shree krishna begins answering arjun questions continues till end chapter each fragment naturally drawn towards whole piece stone drawn force gravitation towards earth the individual soul fragment god infinite bliss hence soul fragment ocean infinite bliss experiences natural urge bliss when strives relish bliss soul god called divine love but ignorance spiritual nature thinks body seeks relish bliss body world called lust this world called mṛiga tṛiṣhṇā scriptures meaning like mirage seen deer the sun rays reflecting hot desert sand create illusion water deer it thinks water ahead runs quench thirst but runs toward water mirage fades away its dull intellect not recognize running illusion the unfortunate deer keeps chasing illusory water dies exhaustion desert sand similarly material energy maya creates illusion happiness run illusory happiness hope quenching thirst senses but matter much try happiness keeps fading away us the garuḍ purāṇ states chakradharo pi suratvaṁ suratvalābhe sakalasurapatitvambhavtirum surapatirūrdhvagatitvaṁ tathāpi nanivartate tṛiṣhṇā a king wishes emperor whole world emperor aspires celestial god celestial god seeks indra king heaven indra desires brahma secondary creator yet thirst material enjoyment not get satiated but one learns turn mind away material allurements renounces desires senses person comes touch inner bliss soul becomes transcendentally situated the kaṭhopaniṣhad goes extent saying one renounced desires becomes like god yadā sarve pramuchyante kāmā ye sya hṛidi śhritaḥatha martyo mṛito bhavatyatra brahma samaśhnute when one eliminates selfish desires heart materially fettered jīvātmā soul attains freedom birth death becomes godlike virtue shree krishna states verse transcendentally situated person one given selfish desires cravings senses satisfied self

If one permits the mind to brood over miseries, then the contemplation on the divine ceases and the mind is dragged down from the transcendental level. The process of torture works in the same manner. More than the present pain itself, it is the memories of past pain and apprehensions of future pain that torment the mind. But when the mind drops these two and has to simply grope with the present sensation, the pain surprisingly shrinks to a manageable (within the limits of tolerance) size. It is well known that historically Buddhist monks adopted a similar technique for tolerating torture from invading conquerors.Similarly, if the mind craves external pleasures, it runs to the objects of enjoyment, and is again diverted from divine contemplation. So a sage of steady wisdom is one who does not allow the mind to hanker for pleasure or lament for miseries. Further, such a sage does not permit the mind to succumb to the urges of fear and anger. In this way, the mind becomes situated on the transcendental level.",in verse shree krishna describes sages steady wisdom vīta give craving pleasure vīta remain free fear vīta devoid angeran enlightened person not allow mind harbor material frailties lust anger greed envy etc only mind steadily contemplate transcendence fixed divine if one permits mind brood miseries contemplation divine ceases mind dragged transcendental level the process torture works manner more present pain memories past pain apprehensions future pain torment mind but mind drops two simply grope present sensation pain surprisingly shrinks manageable within limits tolerance size it well known historically buddhist monks adopted similar technique tolerating torture invading conquerorssimilarly mind craves external pleasures runs objects enjoyment diverted divine contemplation so sage steady wisdom one not allow mind hanker pleasure lament miseries further sage not permit mind succumb urges fear anger in way mind becomes situated transcendental level

One may wonder how an English poet expressed the same state of enlightenment that is described by the Supreme Lord. The fact is that the urge for enlightenment is the intrinsic nature of the soul. Hence, knowingly or unknowingly, everyone craves for it, in all cultures around the world.

2,58,यदा संहरते चायं कूर्मोऽङ्गानीव सर्वश: | इन्द्रियाणीन्द्रियार्थेभ्यस्तस्य प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठिता ॥58॥,"And when this one fully withdraws the senses from the objects of the senses, as a tortoise wholly (withdraws) the limbs, then his wisdom remains established.","Attempting to quench the cravings of the senses by supplying them with their desired objects is like trying to dowse a fire by pouring clarified butter on it. The fire may be smothered for a moment, but then it flares up with redoubled intensity. Hence, the Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam states that desires never go away when they are fulfilled; they only come back more strongly:na jātu kāmaḥ kāmānām upabhogena śhāmyatihaviṣhā kṛiṣhṇa-vartmeva bhūya evābhivardhate (9.19.14) [v49]“Fulfilling the desires of the senses does not extinguish them, just as offering oblations of butter in the fire does not extinguish it; instead, it makes the fire blaze even stronger.”These desires can be compared to an itch in the body. The itch is troublesome and creates an irresistible urge to scratch. But scratching does not solve the problem. For a few moments, there is relief, and then the itch returns with greater force. Instead, if someone can tolerate the itch for some time, it begins losing its sting, and dies down slowly. That is the secret for getting peace from the itch. The same logic applies to desires as well. The mind and senses throw up myriad desires for happiness, but as long as we are in the game of fulfilling them, happiness remains illusory, like the mirage. But when we learn to discard all these desires, to find happiness in God, the mind and senses make peace with us.So an enlightened sage intelligently masters the senses and the mind. The illustration used in this verse is that of the turtle. Whenever it encounters danger, the turtle protects itself by drawing its limbs and head inside its shell. After the danger passes, the turtle again extracts its limbs and head and continues on its way. The enlightened soul possesses similar control over the mind and senses and can retract and extract them according to the needs of the situation.",attempting quench cravings senses supplying desired objects like trying dowse fire pouring clarified butter the fire may smothered moment flares redoubled intensity hence śhrīmad bhāgavatam states desires never go away fulfilled come back strongly na jātu kāmaḥ kāmānām upabhogena śhāmyatihaviṣhā kṛiṣhṇavartmeva bhūya evābhivardhate fulfilling desires senses not extinguish offering oblations butter fire not extinguish instead makes fire blaze even stronger these desires compared itch body the itch troublesome creates irresistible urge scratch but scratching not solve problem for moments relief itch returns greater force instead someone tolerate itch time begins losing sting dies slowly that secret getting peace itch the logic applies desires well the mind senses throw myriad desires happiness long game fulfilling happiness remains illusory like mirage but learn discard desires find happiness god mind senses make peace usso enlightened sage intelligently masters senses mind the illustration used verse turtle whenever encounters danger turtle protects drawing limbs head inside shell after danger passes turtle extracts limbs head continues way the enlightened soul possesses similar control mind senses retract extract according needs situation
2,59,विषया विनिवर्तन्ते निराहारस्य देहिन: | रसवर्जं रसोऽप्यस्य परं दृष्ट्वा निवर्तते ॥59॥,"The objects recede from an abstinent man, with the exception of the taste (for them). Even the taste of this person falls away after realization of the Absolute.","When one gives up eating, as in a fast, the desires of the senses become feeble. Similarly, in sickness one loses interest toward the objects of enjoyment. These states of dispassion are temporary, for the seed of desire remains within the mind. Again when the fast is terminated or the sickness goes away, the desires return.What is this seed of desire? It is the intrinsic nature of the soul for the divine bliss of God, of whom it is a tiny fragment. Until it gets that divine bliss, the soul can never be contented, and the search for happiness will continue. Sādhaks (spiritual aspirants) may forcibly restrain their senses with their will power, but such restrain is temporary because it does not extinguish the internal flame of desire. However, when the soul engages in devotion toward God, and gets divine bliss, it experiences the higher taste for which it had been craving since infinite lifetimes. The Taittirīya Upaniṣhad states:raso vai saḥ rasaṁ hyevāyaṁ labdhvā ’nandī bhavati  (2.7.2)[v50]“God is all-bliss. When the soul attains God, it becomes satiated in bliss.” Then, one naturally develops dispassion toward the lower sensual pleasures. This detachment that comes through devotion is firm and unshakeable.Thus, the Bhagavad Gita does not teach a dry suppression of desires, instead it teaches the beautiful path of sublimation of desires by directing them toward God. The Saint Ramakrishna Paramahamsa expressed this principle very eloquently, when he said: “Devotion is love for the highest; and the lowest shall fall away by itself.”",when one gives eating fast desires senses become feeble similarly sickness one loses interest toward objects enjoyment these states dispassion temporary seed desire remains within mind again fast terminated sickness goes away desires returnwhat seed desire it intrinsic nature soul divine bliss god tiny fragment until gets divine bliss soul never contented search happiness continue sādhaks spiritual aspirants may forcibly restrain senses power restrain temporary not extinguish internal flame desire however soul engages devotion toward god gets divine bliss experiences higher taste craving since infinite lifetimes the taittirīya upaniṣhad states raso vai saḥ rasaṁ hyevāyaṁ labdhvā nandī bhavati god allbliss when soul attains god becomes satiated bliss then one naturally develops dispassion toward lower sensual pleasures this detachment comes devotion firm unshakeablethus bhagavad gita not teach dry suppression desires instead teaches beautiful path sublimation desires directing toward god the saint ramakrishna paramahamsa expressed principle eloquently said devotion love highest lowest shall fall away
2,60,यततो ह्यपि कौन्तेय पुरुषस्य विपश्चित: | इन्द्रियाणि प्रमाथीनि हरन्ति प्रसभं मन: ॥60॥,"For, O son of Kunti, the turbulent organs violently snatch away the mind of an intelligent person, even while he is striving diligently.","The senses are like wild horses that have been newly harnessed. They are impetuous and reckless, and hence, disciplining them is an important battle that sādhaks have to fight within themselves. Therefore, those desirous of spiritual growth should carefully strive to tame the indulgent senses, which are colored with lust and greed, or else they have the power to sabotage and derail the spiritual process of even the most well-intentioned yogis.The Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam relates a story that perfectly illustrates this statement (canto 9, chapter 6). There was a great sage in ancient times, known as Saubhari. He is mentioned in the Rig Veda, where there is a mantra called Saubhari Sutra. There is also a scripture called the Saubhari Samhita. So he was not just an ordinary sage. Saubhari had attained such control over his body that he used to submerge himself in the river Yamuna and meditate under water. One day, he saw two fish mating. This sight carried away his mind and senses, and the desire for sexual association arose in him. He abandoned his spiritual practice and came out of the water, wondering how to fulfill his desire.At that time, the king of Ayodhya was Mandhata, who was a very illustrious and noble ruler. He had fifty daughters, each more beautiful than the other. Saubhari approached the king and asked for the hand of one of the fifty princesses.King Mandhata wondered about the sanity of the sage and thought to himself, “An old man wanting to get married!” The king knew Saubhari to be a powerful sage, and feared that if he refused, the sage might curse him. But if he consented, the life of one of his daughters would be ruined. He was in a dilemma. So he said, “O holy one! I have no objection to your request. Please take a seat. I shall bring my fifty daughters before you, and whosoever chooses you will become yours in marriage.” The king was confident that none of his daughters would choose the old ascetic, and in this way, he would be saved from the sage’s curse.Saubhari was all too aware of the king’s intention. He told the king that he would return the following day. That evening, he used his yogic powers to turn himself into a handsome young man. Consequently, when he presented himself at the palace the next day, all the fifty princesses chose him as their husband. The king was bound by the word he had given and was compelled to marry all his daughters to the sage.Now the king was concerned about the fights that would take place amongst the fifty sisters, since they would have to share a husband. However, Saubhari again used his yogic powers. Putting the king’s apprehension to rest, he assumed fifty forms and created fifty palaces for his wives, and lived separately with each one of them. In this manner, thousands of years passed by. The Puranas state that Saubhari had many children from each of them, and those children had further children, until a tiny city had been created. One day, Saubhari came to his senses, and exclaimed, aho imaṁ paśhyata me vināśhaṁ (Bhāgavatam 9.6.50) [v51] “O humans! Those of you, who make plans to attain happiness through material acquisitions, be careful. Look at my degradation—where I was and where am I now. I created fifty bodies by my yogic powers, and lived with fifty women for thousands of years. And yet, the senses did not experience fulfillment; they only kept hankering for more. Learn from my downfall and be warned not to venture in this direction.”",the senses like wild horses newly harnessed they impetuous reckless hence disciplining important battle sādhaks fight within therefore desirous spiritual growth carefully strive tame indulgent senses colored lust greed else power sabotage derail spiritual process even wellintentioned yogisthe śhrīmad bhāgavatam relates story perfectly illustrates statement canto chapter there great sage ancient times known saubhari he mentioned rig veda mantra called saubhari sutra there also scripture called saubhari samhita so not ordinary sage saubhari attained control body used submerge river yamuna meditate water one day saw two fish mating this sight carried away mind senses desire sexual association arose he abandoned spiritual practice came water wondering fulfill desireat time king ayodhya mandhata illustrious noble ruler he fifty daughters beautiful saubhari approached king asked hand one fifty princessesking mandhata wondered sanity sage thought an old man wanting get married the king knew saubhari powerful sage feared refused sage might curse but consented life one daughters would ruined he dilemma so said o holy one i objection request please take seat i shall bring fifty daughters whosoever chooses become marriage the king confident none daughters would choose old ascetic way would saved sage cursesaubhari aware king intention he told king would return following day that evening used yogic powers turn handsome young man consequently presented palace next day fifty princesses chose husband the king bound word given compelled marry daughters sagenow king concerned fights would take place amongst fifty sisters since would share husband however saubhari used yogic powers putting king apprehension rest assumed fifty forms created fifty palaces wives lived separately one in manner thousands years passed the puranas state saubhari many children children children tiny city created one day saubhari came senses exclaimed aho imaṁ paśhyata vināśhaṁ bhāgavatam o humans those make plans attain happiness material acquisitions careful look i i i created fifty bodies yogic powers lived fifty women thousands years and yet senses not experience fulfillment kept hankering learn downfall warned not venture direction
2,61,तानि सर्वाणि संयम्य युक्त आसीत मत्पर: | वशे हि यस्येन्द्रियाणि तस्य प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठिता ॥61॥,"Controlling all of them, one should remain concentrated on Me as the supreme.

The example of King Ambarish in Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam illustrates this process this very beautifully:sa vai manaḥ kṛiṣhṇa-padāravindayor vacāhṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇanekarau harer mandira-mārjanādiṣhu śhrutiṁ chakārāchyuta-sat-kathodayemukunda-liṅgālaya-darśhane dṛiśhau tad-bhṛitya-gātra-sparśhe ’ṅga-saṅgamamghrāṇaṁ cha tat-pāda-saroja-saurabhe śhrīmat-tulasyā rasanāṁ tad-arpitepādau hareḥ kṣhetra-padānusarpaṇe śhiro hṛiṣhīkeśha-padābhivandanekāmaṁ cha dāsye na tu kāma-kāmyayā yathottamaśhloka-janāśhrayā ratiḥ(9.4.18-20) [v52] “Ambarish engaged his mind in remembering the lotus feet of Shree Krishna.

2,62,ध्यायतो विषयान्पुंस: सङ्गस्तेषूपजायते | सङ्गात्सञ्जायते काम: कामात्क्रोधोऽभिजायते ॥62॥,"In the case of a person who dwells on objects, there arises attachment for them. From attachment grows hankering, from hankering springs anger.","Anger, greed, lust, etc. are considered in the Vedic scriptures as mānas rog, or diseases of the mind. The Ramayan states: mānas roga kachhuka maiṅ gāe hahiṅ saba keṅ lakhi biralenha pāe [v53] We are all aware of the diseases of the body—even a single bodily ailment has the power to make one’s whole day miserable—but we do not realize that we are being continuously tormented by multiple mental ailments. And since we do not recognize lust, anger, greed, etc. as mental diseases, we do not try to cure them. Psychology is a branch of human knowledge that attempts to analyze these ailments and propose solutions to them. However, both the analysis and the solution presented by western psychology leave much to be desired, and appear to be gross approximations of the reality of the mind.In this and the subsequent verse, Shree Krishna has given perfect and penetrating insight into functioning of the mind. He explains that when we repeatedly contemplate that there is happiness in some object, the mind becomes attached to it. For example, in a class there are a number of boys and girls, and they interact innocuously with each other. One day one boy notices something about one girl and starts thinking, “I would be very happy if she were mine.” As he continuously repeats this thought in his mind, his mind becomes attached to her. He tells his friends that he is madly in love with her, and he is unable to study because his mind repeatedly goes to her. His friends ridicule him that they all interact with her in class, but none of them is crazy about her. Why is he losing his sleep and ruining his studies because of her? The fact is that he repeatedly thought that there was happiness in the girl, and so his mind became attached to her.Now attachment seems quite innocuous by itself. But the problem is that from attachment comes desire. If one is attached to drinks, the desire for drinks comes repeatedly to the mind. If one is attached to cigarettes, then thoughts of the pleasure of smoking cigarettes repeatedly flow in the mind, creating a craving for them. In this way, attachment leads to desire.Once desire develops, it gives birth to two more problems—greed and anger. Greed comes from the fulfillment of desire. Jimi pratilābha lobha adhikāī (Ramayan) [v54] “If you satisfy desire, it leads to greed.” Thus desire is never eliminated by satiating it:yat pṛithivyāṁ vrīhi-yavaṁ hiraṇyaṁ paśhavaḥ striyaḥna duhyanti manaḥ-prītiṁ puṁsaḥ kāma-hatasya te (Bhāgavatam 9.19.13) [v55]“If one person were to get all the wealth, luxuries, and sensual objects in the world, that person’s desire would still not be satiated. Hence, knowing it to be the cause of misery, an intelligent person should renounce desire.”On the flip side what happens if the fulfillment of desire is obstructed? It gives rise to anger. Bear in mind that anger does not arise by itself. It is created from the obstruction of desire; and desire arises from attachment, while attachment comes from contemplation of the sense objects. In this manner, we see how the simple act of contemplating the pleasures of sense objects leads downward to the twin diseases of greed and anger. In the next verse Shree Krishna continues the chain further down, and explains the consequences of anger.",anger greed lust etc considered vedic scriptures mānas rog diseases mind the ramayan states mānas roga kachhuka maiṅ gāe hahiṅ saba keṅ lakhi biralenha pāe we aware diseases single bodily ailment power make one whole day not realize continuously tormented multiple mental ailments and since not recognize lust anger greed etc mental diseases not try cure psychology branch human knowledge attempts analyze ailments propose solutions however analysis solution presented western psychology leave much desired appear gross approximations reality mindin subsequent verse shree krishna given perfect penetrating insight functioning mind he explains repeatedly contemplate happiness object mind becomes attached for example class number boys girls interact innocuously one day one boy notices something one girl starts thinking i would happy mine as continuously repeats thought mind mind becomes attached he tells friends madly love unable study mind repeatedly goes his friends ridicule interact class none crazy why losing sleep ruining studies the fact repeatedly thought happiness girl mind became attached hernow attachment seems quite innocuous but problem attachment comes desire if one attached drinks desire drinks comes repeatedly mind if one attached cigarettes thoughts pleasure smoking cigarettes repeatedly flow mind creating craving in way attachment leads desireonce desire develops gives birth two anger greed comes fulfillment desire jimi pratilābha lobha adhikāī ramayan if satisfy desire leads greed thus desire never eliminated satiating yat pṛithivyāṁ vrīhiyavaṁ hiraṇyaṁ paśhavaḥ striyaḥna duhyanti manaḥprītiṁ puṁsaḥ kāmahatasya te bhāgavatam if one person get wealth luxuries sensual objects world person desire would still not satiated hence knowing cause misery intelligent person renounce desire on flip side happens fulfillment desire obstructed it gives rise anger bear mind anger not arise it created obstruction desire desire arises attachment attachment comes contemplation sense objects in manner see simple act contemplating pleasures sense objects leads downward twin diseases greed anger in next verse shree krishna continues chain explains consequences anger

In anger, people commit mistakes that they later regret, because the intellect gets clouded by the haze of emotions. People say, “He is twenty years elder to me. Why did I speak in this manner to him? What happened to me?” What happened was that the faculty of judgment was affected by anger, and hence the mistake of scolding an elder was made.When the intellect is clouded, it leads to bewilderment of memory. The person then forgets what is right and what is wrong, and flows along with the surge of emotions. The downward descent continues from there, and bewilderment of memory results in destruction of the intellect. And since the intellect is the internal guide, when it gets destroyed, one is ruined. In this manner, the path of descent from divinity to impiety has been described beginning with contemplation on the sense objects to the destruction of the intellect.",anger impairs judgment morning mist creates hazy covering sunlight in anger people commit mistakes later regret intellect gets clouded haze emotions people say he twenty years elder why i speak manner what happened what happened faculty judgment affected anger hence mistake scolding elder madewhen intellect clouded leads bewilderment memory the person forgets right wrong flows along surge emotions the downward descent continues bewilderment memory results destruction intellect and since intellect internal guide gets destroyed one ruined in manner path descent divinity impiety described beginning contemplation sense objects destruction intellect

Now, the urge for happiness is as natural to the soul as thirst is to the physical body. It is impossible to think “I will not contemplate happiness anywhere,” because it is unnatural for the soul. The simple solution then is to envision happiness in the proper direction, i.e. in God. If we can repeatedly revise the thought that happiness is in God, we will develop attachment toward him. This divine attachment will not degrade the mind like material attachment; rather, it will purify it. God is all-pure, and when we attach our mind to him, the mind will also become pure.Thus, whenever Shree Krishna asks us to give up attachment and desire, he is referring only to material attachment and desire. Spiritual attachment and desire are not to be given up; in fact, they are most praiseworthy. They are to be cultivated and increased for purification of the mind. The greater the burning desire we develop for God, the purer our mind will become. The jñānīs who propound the worship of the undifferentiated attributeless Brahman do not understand this point when they recommend giving up all attachments. However, Shree Krishna states: “Those who attach their minds to me with unadulterated devotion rise above the three modes of material nature and attain the level of the supreme Brahman.” (Bhagavad Gita 14.26) He repeatedly urges Arjun to attach his mind to God in many verses ahead, such as 8.7, 8.14, 9.22, 9.34, 10.10, 12.8, 11.54, 18.55, 18.58, 18.65, etc.Attachment and aversion are two sides of the same coin. Aversion is nothing but negative attachment. Just as, in attachment, the object of attachment repeatedly comes to one’s mind; similarly, in aversion, the object of hatred keeps popping into the mind. So attachment and aversion to material objects both have the same effect on the mind—they dirty it and pull it into the three modes of material nature. When the mind is free from both attachment and aversion, and is absorbed in devotion to God, one receives the grace of God and experiences his unlimited divine bliss. On experiencing that higher taste, the mind no longer feels attracted to the sense objects, even while using them. Thus, even while tasting, touching, smelling, hearing, and seeing, like all of us, the sthita prajña is free from both attachment and aversion.",the entire downward spiral leading ruin begins contemplating happiness sense objects now urge happiness natural soul thirst physical body it impossible think i not contemplate happiness anywhere unnatural soul the simple solution envision happiness proper direction ie god if repeatedly revise thought happiness god develop attachment toward this divine attachment not degrade mind like material attachment rather purify god allpure attach mind mind also become purethus whenever shree krishna asks us give attachment desire referring material attachment desire spiritual attachment desire not given fact praiseworthy they cultivated increased purification mind the greater burning desire develop god purer mind become the jñānīs propound worship undifferentiated attributeless brahman not understand point recommend giving attachments however shree krishna states those attach minds unadulterated devotion rise three modes material nature attain level supreme brahman bhagavad gita he repeatedly urges arjun attach mind god many verses ahead etcattachment aversion two sides coin aversion nothing negative attachment just attachment object attachment repeatedly comes one mind similarly aversion object hatred keeps popping mind so attachment aversion material objects effect dirty pull three modes material nature when mind free attachment aversion absorbed devotion god one receives grace god experiences unlimited divine bliss on experiencing higher taste mind longer feels attracted sense objects even using thus even tasting touching smelling hearing seeing like us sthita prajña free attachment aversion

By God’s grace, when we experience the higher taste of divine bliss, the agitation for sensual happiness is extinguished. Once that hankering for material objects ceases, one goes beyond all suffering and the mind becomes tranquil. In that state of internal fulfillment, the intellect becomes firm in its decision that God alone is the source of happiness and is the final goal of the soul.

2,66,नास्ति बुद्धिरयुक्तस्य न चायुक्तस्य भावना | न चाभावयत: शान्तिरशान्तस्य कुत: सुखम् ॥66॥,"For the unsteady there is no wisdom, and there is no meditation for the unsteady man. And for an unmeditative man there is no peace. How can there be happiness for one without peace?","This verse strengthens the conclusion of the previous verse by stating the reverse and negating it. Previously, Shree Krishna said “Know God; know peace.” In this verse, he says “No God; no peace.” A person who has not learnt to discipline the mind and senses can neither meditate upon God nor experience his divine bliss. Without the higher taste, it becomes impossible to renounce the lower taste, and such a person keeps hankering for material happiness, like the bee finds it impossible to renounce the nectar of the flower:rātrirgamiṣhyati bhaviṣhyati suprabhātaṁbhāsvānudveṣhyati hasiṣhyati paṅkajaśhrīḥevaṁ vichintayati koṣha gate dvirephehā hanta hanta nalinīṁ gaja ujjahāra (Sukti Sudhakar) ][v56]This popular verse in Sanskrit literature relates a bee’s story. The bee was sitting on a lotus flower, drinking its nectar. As the sun began setting, the petals of the flower began shutting. But the bee was so attached to enjoying the object of its senses that it refused to fly off. It thought, “There is still time for the flower to close. Let me suck some more nectar while I can.” In the same way, we can see old age coming as a sure sign of death, but like the bee, we remain engrossed in enjoying worldly pleasures.In the meantime, it became dark and the lotus flower closed, trapping the bee. It thought, “Never mind! Let me remain inside my beloved flower for tonight. Tomorrow morning, when its petals open again, I will fly away.” Kāṣhṭha bhedo nipuṇopi sangṛihī kuṇṭhito bhavati padma vibhede [v57] “A bee has the power to cut through wood. But look at the attachment to the sense objects that the bee which can cut through wood is stuck inside the soft petals of the lotus.” In the meantime, an elephant came, broke the lotus from the stem, and swallowed it. The bee along with the lotus went into the stomach of the elephant. The bee was thinking, “My beloved lotus is going somewhere, and I am happily going along with it.” It died shortly thereafter.Similarly, we humans too remain engrossed in the gratification of the senses, and do not heed to the message of the Saints to engage in devotion to God. Finally, time overtakes us in the form of death. Here, Shree Krishna says that those who refuse to discipline the senses and engage in devotion continue to be rocked by the three-fold miseries of Maya. Material desires are like an itching eczema, and the more we indulge in them, the worse they become. How can we be truly happy in this state of material indulgence?",this verse strengthens conclusion previous verse stating reverse negating previously shree krishna said know god know peace in verse says no god peace a person not learnt discipline mind senses neither meditate upon god experience divine bliss without higher taste becomes impossible renounce lower taste person keeps hankering material happiness like bee finds impossible renounce nectar flower rātrirgamiṣhyati bhaviṣhyati suprabhātaṁbhāsvānudveṣhyati hasiṣhyati paṅkajaśhrīḥevaṁ vichintayati koṣha gate dvirephehā hanta hanta nalinīṁ gaja ujjahāra sukti sudhakar this popular verse sanskrit literature relates bee story the bee sitting lotus flower drinking nectar as sun began setting petals flower began shutting but bee attached enjoying object senses refused fly it thought there still time flower close let suck nectar i can in way see old age coming sure sign death like bee remain engrossed enjoying worldly pleasuresin meantime became dark lotus flower closed trapping bee it thought never mind let remain inside beloved flower tonight tomorrow morning petals open i fly away kāṣhṭha bhedo nipuṇopi sangṛihī kuṇṭhito bhavati padma vibhede a bee power cut wood but look attachment sense objects bee cut wood stuck inside soft petals lotus in meantime elephant came broke lotus stem swallowed the bee along lotus went stomach elephant the bee thinking my beloved lotus going somewhere i happily going along it it died shortly thereaftersimilarly humans remain engrossed gratification senses not heed message saints engage devotion god finally time overtakes us form death here shree krishna says refuse discipline senses engage devotion continue rocked threefold miseries maya material desires like itching eczema indulge worse become how truly happy state material indulgence

Fish are trapped by the desire for eating, and they swallow the bait of the fishermen. Insects are drawn to light. They come too close to the fire and get burnt. The weakness of elephants is the sense of touch. The hunter uses this to trap the male elephant by using the female elephant as bait to draw it into the pit. On entering the pit to touch the female, the male elephant is unable to get out, and is killed by the hunter. All these creatures get drawn toward their death by one of their senses.

The senses pull the mind in their direction; the mind overpowers the intellect; and the intellect gets derailed from the direction of true welfare. Thus, Shree Krishna says that if the intellect is purified by spiritual knowledge, then the senses will be restrained; and when senses are held in check, the intellect will not be swayed from the path of divine wisdom.",enlightened souls control intellect transcendental knowledge then purified intellect control mind mind used bridle senses however materially conditioned state reverse takes place the senses pull mind direction mind overpowers intellect intellect gets derailed direction true welfare thus shree krishna says intellect purified spiritual knowledge senses restrained senses held check intellect not swayed path divine wisdom

That during which creatures keep awake, it is night to the seeing sage.","Shree Krishna has used day and night figuratively here. People often confuse the meaning of this verse by taking the words literally. There was once a Khade Shree Baba (the standing ascetic), whose disciples claimed he was a very big sage. He had not slept in thirty-five years. He would stand in his room, resting on a hanging rope under his armpits. He used the rope to help him remain in the standing position. On being asked what his motivation was for this destructive kind of austerity, he would quote this verse of the Bhagavad Gita: “What all beings see as night, the enlightened sage sees as day.” So to practice it, he had given up sleeping at night. What a misunderstanding of the verse! From all that standing, his feet and lower legs were swollen, and so he could practically do nothing except stand.Let us try and understand the true meaning of Shree Krishna’s words. Those who are in mundane consciousness look to material enjoyment as the real purpose of life. They consider the opportunity for worldly pleasures as the success of life, or “day,” and deprivation from sense pleasures as darkness, or “night.” On the other hand, those who have become wise with divine knowledge, see sense enjoyment as harmful for the soul, and hence view it as “night.” They consider refraining from the objects of the senses as elevating to the soul, and hence look on it as “day.” Using those connotations of the words, Shree Krishna states that what is night for the sage is day for the worldly-minded people, and vice versa.",shree krishna used day night figuratively people often confuse meaning verse taking words literally there khade shree baba standing ascetic whose disciples claimed big sage he not slept thirtyfive years he would stand room resting hanging rope armpits he used rope help remain standing position on asked motivation destructive kind austerity would quote verse bhagavad gita what beings see night enlightened sage sees day so practice given sleeping night what misunderstanding verse from standing feet lower legs swollen could practically nothing except standlet us try understand true meaning shree krishna words those mundane consciousness look material enjoyment real purpose life they consider opportunity worldly pleasures success life day deprivation sense pleasures darkness night on hand become wise divine knowledge see sense enjoyment harmful soul hence view night they consider refraining objects senses elevating soul hence look day using connotations words shree krishna states night sage day worldlyminded people vice versa

All the rivers of the world constantly empty themselves into the oceans, which neither overflow nor get depleted. Shree Krishna uses the word āpūryamāṇaṁ (filled from all sides) to describe that even the rivers pouring all their water during the rainy season into the ocean cannot make it flow over. Similarly, the realized sage remains quiescent and unmoved in both conditions—while utilizing sense objects for bodily necessities, or being bereft of them.

The moment we harbor a desire, we walk into the trap of greed and anger. Either way, we get trapped. So the path to inner peace does not lie in fulfilling desires, but instead in eliminating them.Greed. Firstly, greed for material advancement is a great waste of time. Secondly, it is an endless chase. In developed countries, very few people are deprived of enough to eat and wear, and yet they remain disturbed; this is because their hankering is still unsatisfied. Thus, those who possess the wealth of contentment possess one of the biggest treasures of life.Ego. Most of the quarrels that erupt between people stem from the ego. Mark H McCormack, author of What They Don’t Teach You At Harvard Business School writes: “Most corporate executives are one giant ego, with a couple of arms and legs sticking out.” Statistics reveal that a majority of executives, who lose their jobs in the senior management level, do so not because of professional incompetence, but because of interpersonal issues. The way to peace is not to nurture and increase pride, but to get rid of it.Proprietorship. The feeling of proprietorship is based upon ignorance because the whole world belongs to God. We came empty-handed in the world, and we will go back empty-handed. How then can we think of worldly things as ours?",in verse shree krishna lists things disturb one peace asks arjun give upmaterial desires the moment harbor desire walk trap greed anger either way get trapped so path inner peace not lie fulfilling desires instead eliminating themgreed firstly greed material advancement great waste time secondly endless chase in developed countries people deprived enough eat wear yet remain disturbed hankering still unsatisfied thus possess wealth contentment possess one biggest treasures lifeego most quarrels erupt people stem ego mark h mccormack author what they don teach you at harvard business school writes most corporate executives one giant ego couple arms legs sticking out statistics reveal majority executives lose jobs senior management level not professional incompetence interpersonal issues the way peace not nurture increase pride get rid itproprietorship the feeling proprietorship based upon ignorance whole world belongs god we came emptyhanded world go back emptyhanded how think worldly things
2,72,एषा ब्राह्मी स्थिति: पार्थ नैनां प्राप्य विमुह्यति | स्थित्वास्यामन्तकालेऽपि ब्रह्मनिर्वाणमृच्छति ॥72॥,"O Partha, this is the state of being established in Brahman. One does not become deluded after attaining this. One attains identification with Brahman by being established in this state even in the closing years of one's life.","Brahman means God, and Brāhmī sthiti means the state of God-realization. When the soul purifies the heart (the mind and intellect are sometimes jointly referred to as the heart), God bestows his divine grace, as mentioned in verse 2.64. By his grace, he grants divine knowledge, divine bliss, and divine love to the soul. All these are divine energies that are given by God to the soul at the time of God-realization.At the same time, he liberates the soul from the bondage of Maya. The sañchit karmas (account of karmas of endless lifetimes) are destroyed. The avidyā, ignorance within, from endless lifetimes in the material world, is dispelled. The influence of tri-guṇas, three modes of material nature, ceases. The tri-doṣhas, three defects of the materially conditioned state come to an end. The pañch-kleśhas, five defects of the material intellect, are destroyed. The pañch-kośhas, five sheaths of the material energy, are burnt. And from that point onward, the soul becomes free from the bondage of Maya for the rest of eternity.When this state of God-realization is achieved, the soul is said to be jīvan mukt, or liberated even while residing in the body. Then, at the time of death, the liberated soul finally discards the corporeal body, and it reaches the Supreme Abode of God. The Rig Veda states:tadviṣhṇoḥ paramaṁ padaṁ sadā paśhyanti sūrayaḥ (1.22.20) [v60]“Once the soul attains God, it always remains in union with him. After that, the ignorance of Maya can never overpower it again.” That state of eternal liberation from Maya is also called nirvāṇ, mokṣha, etc. As a result, liberation is a natural consequence of God-realization.",brahman means god brāhmī sthiti means state godrealization when soul purifies heart mind intellect sometimes jointly referred heart god bestows divine grace mentioned verse by grace grants divine knowledge divine bliss divine love soul all divine energies given god soul time godrealizationat time liberates soul bondage maya the sañchit karmas account karmas endless lifetimes destroyed the avidyā ignorance within endless lifetimes material world dispelled the influence triguṇas three modes material nature ceases the tridoṣhas three defects materially conditioned state come end the pañchkleśhas five defects material intellect destroyed the pañchkośhas five sheaths material energy burnt and point onward soul becomes free bondage maya rest eternitywhen state godrealization achieved soul said jīvan mukt liberated even residing body then time death liberated soul finally discards corporeal body reaches supreme abode god the rig veda states tadviṣhṇoḥ paramaṁ padaṁ sadā paśhyanti sūrayaḥ once soul attains god always remains union after ignorance maya never overpower again that state eternal liberation maya also called nirvāṇ mokṣha etc as result liberation natural consequence godrealization

The first is the acquisition of knowledge through the analytical study of the nature of the soul and its distinction from the body. Shree Krishna refers to this as sānkhya yog. People with a philosophic bend of mind are inclined toward this path of knowing the self through intellectual analysis. The second is the process of working in the spirit of devotion to God, or karm yog. Shree Krishna also calls this buddhi yog¸ as explained in the previous verse. Working in this manner purifies the mind, and knowledge naturally awakens in the purified mind, thus leading to enlightenment.Amongst people interested in the spiritual path, there are those who are inclined toward contemplation and then there are those inclined to action. Hence, both these paths have existed ever since the soul’s aspiration for God-realization has existed. Shree Krishna touches upon both of them since his message is meant for people of all temperaments and inclinations.",in verse shree krishna explained two paths leading spiritual perfection the first acquisition knowledge analytical study nature soul distinction body shree krishna refers sānkhya yog people philosophic bend mind inclined toward path knowing self intellectual analysis the second process working spirit devotion god karm yog shree krishna also calls buddhi explained previous verse working manner purifies mind knowledge naturally awakens purified mind thus leading enlightenmentamongst people interested spiritual path inclined toward contemplation inclined action hence paths existed ever since soul aspiration godrealization existed shree krishna touches upon since message meant people temperaments inclinations
3,4,न कर्मणामनारम्भान्नैष्कर्म्यं पुरुषोऽश्नुते | न च संन्यसनादेव सिद्धिं समधिगच्छति ॥4॥,A person does not attain freedom from action by abstaining from action; nor does he attain fulfilment merely through renunciation.,"The first line of this verse refers to the karm yogi (follower of the discipline of work), and the second line refers to the sānkhya yogi (follower of the discipline of knowledge).In the first line, Shree Krishna says that mere abstinence from work does not result in a state of freedom from karmic reactions. The mind continues to engage in fruitive thoughts, and since mental work is also a form of karma, it binds one in karmic reactions, just as physical work does. A true karm yogi must learn to work without any attachment to the fruits of actions. This requires cultivation of knowledge in the intellect. Hence, philosophic knowledge is also necessary for success in karm yog.In the second line, Shree Krishna declares that the sānkhya yogi cannot attain the state of knowledge merely by renouncing the world and becoming a monk. One may give up the physical objects of the senses, but true knowledge cannot awaken as long as the mind remains impure. The mind has a tendency to repeat its previous thoughts. Such repetition creates a channel within the mind, and new thoughts flow irresistibly in the same direction. Out of previous habit, the materially contaminated mind keeps running in the direction of anxiety, stress, fear, hatred, envy, attachment, and the whole gamut of material emotions. Thus, realized knowledge will not appear in an impure heart by mere physical renunciation. It must be accompanied by congruent action that purifies the mind and intellect. Therefore, action is also necessary for success in sānkhya yog.It is said that devotion without philosophy is sentimentality, and philosophy without devotion is intellectual speculation. Action and knowledge are necessary in both karm yog and sānkhya yog. It is only their proportion that varies, creating the difference between the two paths.",the first line verse refers karm yogi follower discipline work second line refers sānkhya yogi follower discipline knowledge in first line shree krishna says mere abstinence work not result state freedom karmic reactions the mind continues engage fruitive thoughts since mental work also form karma binds one karmic reactions physical work a true karm yogi must learn work without attachment fruits actions this requires cultivation knowledge intellect hence philosophic knowledge also necessary success karm yogin second line shree krishna declares sānkhya yogi not attain state knowledge merely renouncing world becoming monk one may give physical objects senses true knowledge not awaken long mind remains impure the mind tendency repeat previous thoughts such repetition creates channel within mind new thoughts flow irresistibly direction out previous habit materially contaminated mind keeps running direction anxiety stress fear hatred envy attachment whole gamut material emotions thus realized knowledge not appear impure heart mere physical renunciation it must accompanied congruent action purifies mind intellect therefore action also necessary success sānkhya yogit said devotion without philosophy sentimentality philosophy without devotion intellectual speculation action knowledge necessary karm yog sānkhya yog it proportion varies creating difference two paths
3,5,न हि कश्चित्क्षणमपि जातु तिष्ठत्यकर्मकृत् | कार्यते ह्यवश: कर्म सर्व: प्रकृतिजैर्गुणै: ॥5॥,"Because, no one ever remains even for a moment without doing work. For all are made to work under compulsion by the gunas born of Nature.","Some people think that action refers only to professional work, and not to daily activities such as eating, drinking, sleeping, waking and thinking. So when they renounce their profession, they think they are not performing actions. But Shree Krishna considers all activities performed with the body, mind, and tongue as actions. Hence, he tells Arjun that complete inactivity is impossible even for a moment. If we simply sit down, it is an activity; if we lie down, that is also an activity; if we fall asleep, the mind is still engaged in dreaming; even in deep sleep, the heart and other bodily organs are functioning. Thus Shree Krishna declares that for human beings inactivity is an impossible state to reach, since the body-mind-intellect mechanism is compelled by its own make-up of the three guṇas (sattva, rajas, and tamas) to perform work in the world. The Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam contains a similar verse:na hi kaśhchit kṣhaṇam api jātu tiṣhṭhaty akarma-kṛitkāryate hy avaśhaḥ karma guṇaiḥ svābhāvikair balāt (6.1.53)[v1]“Nobody can remain inactive for even a moment. Everyone is forced to act by their modes of nature.”",some people think action refers professional work not daily activities eating drinking sleeping waking thinking so renounce profession think not performing actions but shree krishna considers activities performed body mind tongue actions hence tells arjun complete inactivity impossible even moment if simply sit activity lie also activity fall asleep mind still engaged dreaming even deep sleep heart bodily organs functioning thus shree krishna declares human beings inactivity impossible state reach since bodymindintellect mechanism compelled makeup three guṇas sattva rajas tamas perform work world the śhrīmad bhāgavatam contains similar verse na hi kaśhchit kṣhaṇam api jātu tiṣhṭhaty akarmakṛitkāryate hy avaśhaḥ karma guṇaiḥ svābhāvikair balāt nobody remain inactive even moment everyone forced act modes nature
3,6,कर्मेन्द्रियाणि संयम्य य आस्ते मनसा स्मरन् | इन्द्रियार्थान्विमूढात्मा मिथ्याचार: स उच्यते ॥6॥,"One, who after withdrawing the organs of action, sits mentally recollecting the objects of the senses, that one, of deluded mind, is called a hypocrite.","Attracted by the lure of an ascetic life, people often renounce their work, only to discover later that their renunciation is not accompanied by an equal amount of mental and intellectual withdrawal from the sensual fields. This creates a situation of hypocrisy where one displays an external show of religiosity while internally living a life of ignoble sentiments and base motives. Hence, it is better to face the struggles of the world as a karm yogi, than to lead the life of a false ascetic. Running away from the problems of life by prematurely taking sanyās is not the way forward in the journey of the evolution of the soul. Saint Kabir stated sarcastically:mana na raṅgāye ho, raṅgāye yogī kapaṛājatavā baḍhāe yogī dhuniyā ramaule, dahiyā baḍhāe yogī bani gayele bakarā[v2]“O Ascetic Yogi, you have donned the ochre robes, but you have ignored dyeing your mind with the color of renunciation. You have grown long locks of hair and smeared ash on your body (as a sign of detachment). But without the internal devotion, the external beard you have sprouted only makes you resemble a goat.” Shree Krishna states in this verse that people who externally renounce the objects of the senses while continuing to dwell upon them in the mind are hypocrites, and they delude themselves.The Puranas relate the story of two brothers, Tavrit and Suvrit, to illustrate this point. The brothers were walking from their house to hear the Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam discourse at the temple. On the way, it began raining heavily, so they ran into the nearest building for shelter. To their dismay, they found themselves in a brothel, where women of disrepute were dancing to entertain their guests. Tavrit, the elder brother, was appalled and walked out into the rain, to continue to the temple. The younger brother, Suvrit, felt no harm in sitting there for a while to escape getting wet in the rain.Tavrit reached the temple and sat for the discourse, but in his mind he became remorseful, “O how boring this is! I made a dreadful mistake; I should have remained at the brothel. My brother must be enjoying himself greatly in revelry there.” Suvrit, on the other hand, started thinking, “Why did I remain in this house of sin? My brother is so holy; he is bathing his intellect in the knowledge of the Bhāgavatam. I too should have braved the rain and reached there. After all, I am not made of salt that I would have melted in a little bit of rain.”When the rain stopped, both started out in the direction of the other. The moment they met, lightning struck them and they both died on the spot. The Yamdoots (servants of the god of Death) came to take Tavrit to hell. Tavrit complained, “I think you have made a mistake. I am Tavrit. It was my brother who was sitting at the brothel a little while ago. You should be taking him to hell.” The Yamdoots replied, “We have made no mistake. He was sitting there to avoid the rain, but in his mind he was longing to be at the Bhāgavatam discourse.

3,7,यस्त्विन्द्रियाणि मनसा नियम्यारभतेऽर्जुन | कर्मेन्द्रियै: कर्मयोगमसक्त: स विशिष्यते ॥7॥,"But, O Arjuna, one who engages in Karma-yoga with the organs of action, controlling the organs with the mind and becoming unattached-that one excels.","The word karm yog has been used in this verse. It consists of two main concepts: karm (occupational duties) and Yog (union with God). Hence, a karm yogi is one who performs worldly duties while keeping the mind attached to God. Such a karm yogi is not bound by karma even while performing all kinds of works. This is because what binds one to the law of karma is not actions, but the attachment to the fruits of those actions. And a karm yogi has no attachment to the fruits of action. On the other hand, a false renunciant renounces action, but does not forsake attachment, and thus remains bound in the law of karma.Shree Krishna says here that a person in household life who practices karm yog is superior to the false renunciant who continues to dwell on the objects of the senses in the mind. Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj contrasts these two situations very beautifully:mana hari meṅ tana jagat meṅ, karmayog tehi jānatana hari meṅ mana jagat meṅ, yaha mahāna ajñāna(Bhakti Śhatak verse 84) [v3]“When one works in the world with the body, but keeps the mind attached to God, know it to be karm yog.

3,8,नियतं कुरु कर्म त्वं कर्म ज्यायो ह्यकर्मण: | शरीरयात्रापि च ते न प्रसिद्ध्येदकर्मण: ॥8॥,"You perform the obligatory duties, for action is superior to inaction. And, through inaction, even the maintenance of your body will not be possible.","Until the mind and intellect reach a state where they are absorbed in God-consciousness, physical work performed in an attitude of duty is very beneficial for one’s internal purification. Hence, the Vedas prescribe duties for humans, to help them discipline their mind and senses. In fact, laziness is described as one of the biggest pitfalls on the spiritual path:ālasya hi manuṣhyāṇāṁ śharīrastho mahān ripuḥnāstyudyamasamo bandhūḥ kṛitvā yaṁ nāvasīdati [v4]“Laziness is the greatest enemy of humans, and is especially pernicious since it resides in their own body. Work is their most trustworthy friend, and is a guarantee against downfall.” Even the basic bodily activities like eating, bathing, and maintaining proper health require work. These obligatory actions are called nitya karm. To neglect these basic maintenance activities is not a sign of progress, but an indication of slothfulness, leading to emaciation and weakness of both body and mind. On the other hand, a cared for and nourished body is a positive adjunct on the road to spirituality. Thus, the state of inertia does not lend itself either to material or spiritual achievement. For the progress of our own soul, we should embrace the duties that help elevate and purify our mind and intellect.",until mind intellect reach state absorbed godconsciousness physical work performed attitude duty beneficial one internal purification hence vedas prescribe duties humans help discipline mind senses in fact laziness described one biggest pitfalls spiritual path ālasya hi manuṣhyāṇāṁ śharīrastho mahān ripuḥnāstyudyamasamo bandhūḥ kṛitvā yaṁ nāvasīdati laziness greatest enemy humans especially pernicious since resides body work trustworthy friend guarantee downfall even basic bodily activities like eating bathing maintaining proper health require work these obligatory actions called nitya karm to neglect basic maintenance activities not sign progress indication slothfulness leading emaciation weakness body mind on hand cared nourished body positive adjunct road spirituality thus state inertia not lend either material spiritual achievement for progress soul embrace duties help elevate purify mind intellect
3,9,यज्ञार्थात्कर्मणोऽन्यत्र लोकोऽयं कर्मबन्धन: | तदर्थं कर्म कौन्तेय मुक्तसङ्ग: समाचर ॥9॥,"This man becomes bound by actions other than that action meant for God. Without being attached, O son of Kunti, you perform actions for Him.","A knife in the hands of a robber is a weapon for intimidation or committing murder, but in the hands of a surgeon is an invaluable instrument used for saving people’s lives. The knife in itself is neither murderous nor benedictory—its effect is determined by how it is used. As Shakespeare said: “For there is nothing good or bad, but thinking makes it so.” Similarly, work in itself is neither good nor bad. Depending upon the state of the mind, it can be either binding or elevating. Work done for the enjoyment of one’s senses and the gratification of one’s pride is the cause of bondage in the material world, while work performed as yajña (sacrifice) for the pleasure of the Supreme Lord liberates one from the bonds of Maya and attracts divine grace. Since it is our nature to perform actions, we are forced to work in one of the two modes. We cannot remain without working for even a moment as our mind cannot remain still.If we do not perform actions as a sacrifice to God, we will be forced to work to gratify our mind and senses. Instead, when we perform work as a sacrifice, we then look upon the whole world and everything in it as belonging to God, and therefore, meant for utilization in his service. A beautiful ideal for this was established by King Raghu, the ancestor of Lord Ram. Raghu performed the Viśhwajit sacrifice, which requires donating all of one’s possessions in charity.sa viśhwajitam ājahre yajñaṁ sarvasva dakṣhiṇamādānaṁ hi visargāya satāṁ vārimuchām iva (Raghuvanśh 4.86)[v5]“Raghu performed the Viśhwajit yajña with the thought that just as clouds gather water from the Earth, not for their enjoyment, but to shower it back upon the Earth, similarly, all he possessed as a king had been gathered from the public in taxes, not for his pleasure, but for the pleasure of God. So he decided to use his wealth to please God by serving his citizens with it.” After the yajña, Raghu donated all his possessions to his citizens. Then, donning the rags of a beggar and holding an earthen pot, he went out to beg for his meal.While resting under a tree, he heard a group of people discussing, “Our king is so benevolent. He has given away everything in charity.” Raghu was pained on hearing his praise and spoke out, “What are you discussing?” They answered, “We are praising our king. There is nobody in the world as charitable as him.” Raghu retorted, “Do not ever say that again. Raghu has given nothing.” They said, “What kind of person are you who are criticizing our king? Everyone knows that Raghu has donated everything he owned.” Raghu replied, “Go and ask your king that when he came into this world did he possess anything? He was born empty-handed, is it not? Then what was his that he has given away?”This is the spirit of karm yog, in which we see the whole world as belonging to God, and hence meant for the satisfaction of God. We then perform our duties not for gratifying our mind and senses, but for the pleasure of God. Lord Vishnu instructed the Prachetas in this fashion:gṛiheṣhv āviśhatāṁ chāpi puṁsāṁ kuśhala-karmaṇāmmad-vārtā-yāta-yāmānāṁ na bandhāya gṛihā matāḥ (Bhāgavatam 4.30.19)[v6]“The perfect karm yogis, even while fulfilling their household duties, perform all their works as yajña to me, knowing me to be the Enjoyer of all activities. They spend whatever free time they have in hearing and chanting my glories. Such people, though living in the world, never get bound by their actions.”",a knife hands robber weapon intimidation committing murder hands surgeon invaluable instrument used saving people lives the knife neither murderous effect determined used as shakespeare said for nothing good bad thinking makes so similarly work neither good bad depending upon state mind either binding elevating work done enjoyment one senses gratification one pride cause bondage material world work performed yajña sacrifice pleasure supreme lord liberates one bonds maya attracts divine grace since nature perform actions forced work one two modes we not remain without working even moment mind not remain stillif not perform actions sacrifice god forced work gratify mind senses instead perform work sacrifice look upon whole world everything belonging god therefore meant utilization service a beautiful ideal established king raghu ancestor lord ram raghu performed viśhwajit sacrifice requires donating one possessions charitysa viśhwajitam ājahre yajñaṁ sarvasva dakṣhiṇamādānaṁ hi visargāya satāṁ vārimuchām iva raghuvanśh raghu performed viśhwajit yajña thought clouds gather water earth not enjoyment shower back upon earth similarly possessed king gathered public taxes not pleasure pleasure god so decided use wealth please god serving citizens it after yajña raghu donated possessions citizens then donning rags beggar holding earthen pot went beg mealwhile resting tree heard group people discussing our king benevolent he given away everything charity raghu pained hearing praise spoke what discussing they answered we praising king there nobody world charitable him raghu retorted do not ever say raghu given nothing they said what kind person criticizing king everyone knows raghu donated everything owned raghu replied go ask king came world possess anything he born emptyhanded not then given away this spirit karm yog see whole world belonging god hence meant satisfaction god we perform duties not gratifying mind senses pleasure god lord vishnu instructed prachetas fashion gṛiheṣhv āviśhatāṁ chāpi puṁsāṁ kuśhalakarmaṇāmmadvārtāyātayāmānāṁ na bandhāya gṛihā matāḥ bhāgavatam the perfect karm yogis even fulfilling household duties perform works yajña knowing enjoyer activities they spend whatever free time hearing chanting glories such people though living world never get bound actions
3,10,सहयज्ञा: प्रजा: सृष्ट्वा पुरोवाच प्रजापति: | अनेन प्रसविष्यध्वमेष वोऽस्त्विष्टकामधुक् ॥10॥,"In the days of yore, having created the beings together with the sacrifices, Prajapati said: 'By this you multiply. Let this be your yielder of coveted objects of desire.'","All the elements of nature are integral parts of the system of God’s creation. All the parts of the system naturally draw from and give back to the whole. The sun lends stability to the earth and provides heat and light necessary for life to exist. Earth creates food from its soil for our nourishment and also holds essential minerals in its womb for a civilized lifestyle. The air moves the life force in our body and enables transmission of sound energy. We humans too are an integral part of the entire system of God’s creation. The air that we breathe, the Earth that we walk upon, the water that we drink, and the light that illumines our day, are all gifts of creation to us. While we partake of these gifts to sustain our lives, we also have our duties toward the integral system. Shree Krishna says that we are obligated to participate with the creative force of nature by performing our prescribed duties in the service of God. That is the yajña he expects from us.Consider the example of a hand. It is an integral part of the body. It receives its nourishment—blood, oxygen, nutrients, etc.—from the body, and in turn, it performs necessary functions for the body. If the hand looks on this service as burdensome, and decides to get severed from the body, it cannot sustain itself for even a few minutes. It is in the performance of its yajña toward the body that the self-interest of the hand is also fulfilled. Similarly, we individual souls are tiny parts of the Supreme Soul and we all have our role to play in the grand scheme of things. When we perform our yajña toward him, our self-interest is naturally satiated.Generally, the term yajña refers to fire sacrifice. In the Bhagavad Gita, yajña includes all the prescribed actions laid down in the scriptures, when they are done as an offering to the Supreme.",all elements nature integral parts system god creation all parts system naturally draw give back whole the sun lends stability earth provides heat light necessary life exist earth creates food soil nourishment also holds essential minerals womb civilized lifestyle the air moves life force body enables transmission sound energy we humans integral part entire system god creation the air breathe earth walk upon water drink light illumines day gifts creation us while partake gifts sustain lives also duties toward integral system shree krishna says obligated participate creative force nature performing prescribed duties service god that yajña expects usconsider example hand it integral part body it receives oxygen nutrients body turn performs necessary functions body if hand looks service burdensome decides get severed body not sustain even minutes it performance yajña toward body selfinterest hand also fulfilled similarly individual souls tiny parts supreme soul role play grand scheme things when perform yajña toward selfinterest naturally satiatedgenerally term yajña refers fire sacrifice in bhagavad gita yajña includes prescribed actions laid scriptures done offering supreme
3,11,देवान्भावयतानेन ते देवा भावयन्तु व: | परस्परं भावयन्त: श्रेय: परमवाप्स्यथ ॥11॥,"'You nourish the gods with this. Let those gods nourish you. Nourishing one another, you shall attain the supreme Good.'","The celestial gods, or devatās, are in-charge of the administration of the universe. The Supreme Lord does his work of managing the universe through them. These devatās live within this material universe, in the higher planes of existence, called swarg, or the celestial abodes. The devatās are not God; they are souls like us. They occupy specific posts in the affairs of running the world. Consider the Federal government of a country. There is a Secretary of State, a Secretary of the Treasury, a Secretary of Defense, Attorney General, and so on. These are posts, and chosen people occupy those posts for a limited tenure. At the end of the tenure, the government changes and all the post-holders change too. Similarly, in administering the affairs of the world, there are posts such as Agni Dev (the god of fire), Vāyu Dev (the god of the wind), Varuṇa Dev (the god of the ocean), Indra Dev (the king of the celestial gods), etc. Souls selected by virtue of their deeds in past lives occupy these seats for a fixed number of ages, and administer the affairs of the universe. These are the devatās (celestial gods).The Vedas mention various ceremonies and processes for the satisfaction of the celestial gods, and in turn these devatās bestow material prosperity. However, when we perform our yajña for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, the celestial gods are automatically appeased, just as when we water the root of a tree, the water inevitably reaches its flowers, fruits, leaves, branches, and twigs. The Skandh Purāṇ states:archite deva deveśhe śhaṅkha chakra gadādharearchitāḥ sarve devāḥ syur yataḥ sarva gato hariḥ [v7]“By worshipping the Supreme Lord Shree Vishnu, we automatically worship all the celestial gods, since they all derive their power from him.” Thus, the performance of yajña is naturally pleasing to the devatās, who then create prosperity for living beings by favorably adjusting the elements of material nature.",the celestial gods devatās incharge administration universe the supreme lord work managing universe these devatās live within material universe higher planes existence called swarg celestial abodes the devatās not god souls like us they occupy specific posts affairs running world consider federal government country there secretary state secretary treasury secretary defense attorney general these posts chosen people occupy posts limited tenure at end tenure government changes postholders change similarly administering affairs world posts agni dev god fire vāyu dev god wind varuṇa dev god ocean indra dev king celestial gods etc souls selected virtue deeds past lives occupy seats fixed number ages administer affairs universe these devatās celestial gods the vedas mention various ceremonies processes satisfaction celestial gods turn devatās bestow material prosperity however perform yajña satisfaction supreme lord celestial gods automatically appeased water root tree water inevitably reaches flowers fruits leaves branches twigs the skandh purāṇ states archite deva deveśhe śhaṅkha chakra gadādharearchitāḥ sarve devāḥ syur yataḥ sarva gato hariḥ by worshipping supreme lord shree vishnu automatically worship celestial gods since derive power him thus performance yajña naturally pleasing devatās create prosperity living beings favorably adjusting elements material nature
3,12,इष्टान्भोगान्हि वो देवा दास्यन्ते यज्ञभाविता: | तैर्दत्तानप्रदायैभ्यो यो भुङ्क्ते स्तेन एव स: ॥12॥,"'Being nourished by sacrifices, the gods will indeed give you the coveted enjoyments. He is certainly a thief who enjoys what have been given by them without offering (these) to them.'","As administrators of various processes of the universe, the devatās provide us with rain, wind, crops, vegetation, minerals, fertile soil, etc. We human beings are indebted to them for all that we receive from them. The devatās perform their duty, and expect us to perform our duty in the proper consciousness too. Since these celestial gods are all servants of the Supreme Lord, they become pleased when someone performs a sacrifice for him, and in turn assist such a soul by creating favorable material conditions. Thus, it is said that when we strongly resolve to serve God, the universe begins to cooperate with us.However, if we begin looking upon the gifts of nature, not as means of serving the Lord but as objects of our own enjoyment, Shree Krishna calls it a thieving mentality. Often people ask the question, “I lead a virtuous life; I do not harm anyone, nor do I steal anything. But I do not believe in worshipping God, nor do I believe in him. Am I doing anything wrong?” This question is answered in the above verse. Such persons may not be doing anything wrong in the eyes of humans, but they are thieves in the eyes of God. Let us say, we walk into someone’s house, and without recognizing the owner, we sit on the sofa, eat from the refrigerator, and use the restroom. We may claim that we are not doing anything wrong, but we will be considered thieves in the eyes of the law, because the house does not belong to us. Similarly, the world that we live in was made by God, and everything in it belongs to him. If we utilize his creation for our pleasure, without acknowledging his dominion over it, from the divine perspective we are certainly committing theft.The famous king in Indian history, Chandragupta, asked Chanakya Pundit, his Guru, “According to the Vedic scriptures, what is the position of the king vis-à-vis his subjects?” Chanakya Pundit replied, “The king is the servant of the subjects and nothing else. His God-given duty is to help the citizens of his kingdom progress in their journey toward God-realization.” Whether one is a king, a businessperson, a farmer, or a worker, each person, as an integral member of God’s world, is expected to do his or her duty as a service to the Supreme.",as administrators various processes universe devatās provide us rain wind crops vegetation minerals fertile soil etc we human beings indebted receive the devatās perform duty expect us perform duty proper consciousness since celestial gods servants supreme lord become pleased someone performs sacrifice turn assist soul creating favorable material conditions thus said strongly resolve serve god universe begins cooperate ushowever begin looking upon gifts nature not means serving lord objects enjoyment shree krishna calls thieving mentality often people ask question i lead virtuous life i not harm anyone i steal anything but i not believe worshipping god i believe am i anything wrong this question answered verse such persons may not anything wrong eyes humans thieves eyes god let us say walk someone house without recognizing owner sit sofa eat refrigerator use restroom we may claim not anything wrong considered thieves eyes law house not belong us similarly world live made god everything belongs if utilize creation pleasure without acknowledging dominion divine perspective certainly committing theftthe famous king indian history chandragupta asked chanakya pundit guru according vedic scriptures position king visàvis subjects chanakya pundit replied the king servant subjects nothing else his godgiven duty help citizens kingdom progress journey toward godrealization whether one king businessperson farmer worker person integral member god world expected duty service supreme
3,13,यज्ञशिष्टाशिन: सन्तो मुच्यन्ते सर्वकिल्बिषै: | भुञ्जते ते त्वघं पापा ये पचन्त्यात्मकारणात् ॥13॥,"By becoming partakers of the remembers of sacrifices, they become freed from all sins. But the unholy persons who cook for themselves, they incur sin.","In the Vedic tradition, food is cooked with the consciousness that the meal is for the pleasure of God. A portion of the food items is then put in a plate and a verbal or mental prayer is made for the Lord to come and eat it. After the offering, the food in the plate is considered prasād (grace of God). All the food in the plate and the pots is then accepted as God’s grace and eaten in that consciousness. Other religious traditions follow similar customs. Christianity has the sacrament of the Eucharist, where bread and wine are consecrated and then partaken. Shree Krishna states in this verse that eating prasād (food that is first offered as sacrifice to God) releases one from sin, while those who eat food without offering commit sin.The question may arise whether we can offer non-vegetarian items to God and then accept the remnants as his prasād. The answer to this question is that the Vedas prescribe a vegetarian diet for humans, which includes grains, pulses and beans, vegetables, fruits, dairy products, etc. Apart from the Vedic culture, many spiritually evolved souls in the history of all cultures around the world also rejected a non-vegetarian diet that makes the stomach a graveyard for animals. Even though many of them were born in meat-eating families, they gravitated to a vegetarian lifestyle as they advanced on the path of spirituality. Here are quotations from some famous thinkers and personalities advocating vegetarianism:“To avoid causing terror to living beings, let the disciple refrain from eating meat… the food of the wise is that which is consumed by the sādhus; it does not consist of meat.” The Buddha.“If you declare that you are naturally designed for such a diet, then first kill for yourself what you want to eat. Do it, however, only through your own resources, unaided by cleaver or cudgel or any kind of ax.” The Roman Plutarch, in the essay, “On Eating Flesh.”“As long as men massacre animals, they will kill each other. Indeed, he who sows the seeds of murder and pain cannot reap joy and love.” Pythagoras“Truly man is the king of beasts, for his brutality exceeds them. We live by the death of others. We are burial places! I have since an early age abjured the use of meat…” Leonardo da Vinci.“Nonviolence leads to the highest ethics, which is the goal of all evolution. Until we stop harming all living beings, we are all savages.” Thomas Edison.“Flesh-eating is simply immoral, as it involves the performance of an act which is contrary to moral feeling—killing.”  Leo Tolstoy.“It may indeed be doubted whether butchers’ meat is anywhere a necessary of life… Decency nowhere requires that any man should eat butchers’ meat.” Adam Smith.“I look my age. It is the other people who look older than they are. What can you expect from people who eat corpses?” George Bernard Shaw.“A dead cow or sheep lying in a pasture is recognized as carrion. The same sort of carcass dressed and hung up in a butcher’s stall passes as food!” J. H. Kellogg.“It is my view that the vegetarian manner of living, by its purely physical effect on the human temperament, would most beneficially influence the lot of mankind.” Albert Einstein“I do feel that spiritual progress does demand at some stage that we should cease to kill our fellow creatures for the satisfaction of our bodily wants.” Mahatma GandhiIn this verse, Shree Krishna goes further and says that even vegetation contains life, and if we eat it for our own sense enjoyment, we get bound in the karmic reactions of destroying life. The word used in the verse is ātma-kāraṇāt, meaning “for one’s individual pleasure.” However, if we eat food as remnants of yajña offered to God then the consciousness changes. We then look upon our body as the property of God, which has been put under our care for his service. And we partake of permitted food, as his grace, with the intention that it will nourish the body. In this sentiment, the entire process is consecrated to the Divine. Bharat Muni states:vasusato kratu dakṣhau kāla kāmau dṛitiḥ kuruḥpururavā madravāśhcha viśhwadevāḥ prakīrtitāḥ [v8]“Violence is caused unknowingly to living entities in the process of cooking, by the use of the pestle, fire, grinding instruments, water pot, and broom. Those who cook food for themselves become implicated in the sin. But yajña nullifies the sinful reactions.”",in vedic tradition food cooked consciousness meal pleasure god a portion food items put plate verbal mental prayer made lord come eat after offering food plate considered prasād grace god all food plate pots accepted god grace eaten consciousness other religious traditions follow similar customs christianity sacrament eucharist bread wine consecrated partaken shree krishna states verse eating prasād food first offered sacrifice god releases one sin eat food without offering commit sinthe question may arise whether offer nonvegetarian items god accept remnants prasād the answer question vedas prescribe vegetarian diet humans includes grains pulses beans vegetables fruits dairy products etc apart vedic culture many spiritually evolved souls history cultures around world also rejected nonvegetarian diet makes stomach graveyard animals even though many born meateating families gravitated vegetarian lifestyle advanced path spirituality here quotations famous thinkers personalities advocating vegetarianism to avoid causing terror living beings let disciple refrain eating food wise consumed sādhus not consist meat the buddha if declare naturally designed diet first kill want eat do however resources unaided cleaver cudgel kind ax the roman plutarch essay on eating flesh as long men massacre animals kill indeed sows seeds murder pain not reap joy love pythagoras truly man king beasts brutality exceeds we live death others we burial places i since early age abjured use leonardo da vinci nonviolence leads highest ethics goal evolution until stop harming living beings savages thomas edison flesheating simply immoral involves performance act contrary moral leo tolstoy it may indeed doubted whether butchers meat anywhere necessary decency nowhere requires man eat butchers meat adam smith i look age it people look older what expect people eat corpses george bernard shaw a dead cow sheep lying pasture recognized carrion the sort carcass dressed hung butcher stall passes food j h kellogg it view vegetarian manner living purely physical effect human temperament would beneficially influence lot mankind albert einstein i feel spiritual progress demand stage cease kill fellow creatures satisfaction bodily wants mahatma gandhiin verse shree krishna goes says even vegetation contains life eat sense enjoyment get bound karmic reactions destroying life the word used verse ātmakāraṇāt meaning one individual pleasure however eat food remnants yajña offered god consciousness changes we look upon body property god put care service and partake permitted food grace intention nourish body in sentiment entire process consecrated divine bharat muni states vasusato kratu dakṣhau kāla kāmau dṛitiḥ kuruḥpururavā madravāśhcha viśhwadevāḥ prakīrtitāḥ violence caused unknowingly living entities process cooking use pestle fire grinding instruments water pot broom those cook food become implicated sin but yajña nullifies sinful reactions

These duties have been planned in such a way that through their performance materially engrossed persons may gradually learn to control their desires and slowly elevate themselves from the mode of ignorance to the mode of passion, and from the mode of passion to the mode of goodness. These duties are enjoined to be dedicated to him as yajña. Hence, duties consecrated as sacrifice to God verily become godly, of the nature of God, and non-different from him.The Tantra Sār states yajña to be the Supreme Divine Lord himself:yajño yajña pumāṁśh chaiva yajñaśho yajña yajñabhāvanaḥyajñabhuk cheti pañchātmā yajñeṣhvijyo hariḥ svayaṁ [v10]In the Bhāgavatam (11.19.39), Shree Krishna declares to Uddhav: yajño ’haṁ bhagavattamaḥ [v11]“I, the Son of Vasudev, am Yajña.” The Vedas state: yajño vai viṣhṇuḥ [v12] “Yajña is indeed Lord Vishnu himself.” Reiterating this principle, Shree Krishna says in this verse that God is eternally present in the act of sacrifice.",the vedas emanated breath god asya mahato bhūtasya ni śhvasitametad yadṛigvedo yajurvedaḥ sāmavedo thavaṅgirasaḥ bṛihadāraṇyak upaniṣhad the four veda yajur veda sāma veda atharva emanated breath supreme divine personality in eternal vedas duties humans laid god these duties planned way performance materially engrossed persons may gradually learn control desires slowly elevate mode ignorance mode passion mode passion mode goodness these duties enjoined dedicated yajña hence duties consecrated sacrifice god verily become godly nature god nondifferent himthe tantra sār states yajña supreme divine lord yajño yajña pumāṁśh chaiva yajñaśho yajña yajñabhāvanaḥyajñabhuk cheti pañchātmā yajñeṣhvijyo hariḥ svayaṁ in bhāgavatam shree krishna declares uddhav yajño haṁ bhagavattamaḥ i son vasudev yajña the vedas state yajño vai viṣhṇuḥ yajña indeed lord vishnu himself reiterating principle shree krishna says verse god eternally present act sacrifice

The cycle from grains to rains has been described in verse 3.14. All members of this universal wheel of action perform their duties and contribute to its smooth rotation. Since we also partake of the fruits of this natural cycle, we too must do our bounden duty in the chain.We humans are the only ones in this chain who have been bestowed with the ability to choose our actions by our own free will. We can thus either contribute to the harmony of the cycle or bring about discord in the smooth running of this cosmic mechanism. When the majority of the people of human society accept their responsibility to live as integral parts of the universal system, material prosperity abounds and spiritual growth is engendered. Such periods become golden eras in the social and cultural history of humankind. Conversely, when a major section of humankind begins to violate the universal system and rejects its responsibility as an integral part of the cosmic system, then material nature begins to punish, and peace and prosperity become scarce.The wheel of nature has been set up by God for disciplining, training, and elevating all living beings of varying levels of consciousness. Shree Krishna explains to Arjun that those who do not perform the yajña enjoined of them become slaves of their senses and lead a sinful existence. Thus, they live in vain.

3,17,यस्त्वात्मरतिरेव स्यादात्मतृप्तश्च मानव: | आत्मन्येव च सन्तुष्टस्तस्य कार्यं न विद्यते ॥17॥,"But that man who rejoices only in the Self and is satisfied with the Self, and is contented only in the Self-for him there is no duty to perform.","Only those who have given up desires for external objects can rejoice and be satisfied in the self. The root of bondage is our material desires, “This should happen; that should not happen.” Shree Krishna explains a little further ahead in this chapter (in verse 3.37) that desire is the cause of all sins, consequently, it must be renounced. As explained previously (in the purport of verse 2.64), it must be borne in mind that whenever Shree Krishna says we should give up desire, he refers to material desires, and not to the aspirations for spiritual progress or the desire to realize God.However, why do material desires arise in the first place? When we identify the self with the body, we identify with the yearnings of the body and mind as the desires of the self, and these send us spinning into the realm of Maya. Sage Tulsidas explains:jiba jiba te hari te bilagāno taba te deha geha nija mānyo,māyā basa swarūp bisarāyo tehi brama te dāruṇa duḥkh pāyo. [ v13]“When the soul separated itself from God, the material energy covered it in an illusion. By virtue of that illusion, it began thinking of itself as the body, and ever since, in forgetfulness of the self, it has been experiencing immense misery.”Those who are illumined realize that the self is not material in nature, but divine, and hence imperishable. The perishable objects of the world can never fulfill the thirst of the imperishable soul, and therefore it is a folly to hanker after those sense-objects. Thus, self-illumined souls learn to unite their consciousness with God and experience his infinite bliss within them.The karm (duties) prescribed for the materially conditioned souls are no longer applicable to such illumined souls because they have already attained the goal of all such karm. For example, as long as one is a college student, one is obliged to follow the rules of the university, but for one who has graduated and earned the degree, the rules now become irrelevant. For such liberated souls, it is said: brahmavit śhruti mūrdhnī[v14] “Those who have united themselves with God now walk on the head of the Vedas,” i.e. they have no need to follow the rules of the Vedas any longer.The goal of the Vedas is to help unite the soul with God. Once the soul becomes God-realized, the rules of the Vedas, which helped the soul to reach that destination, now no longer apply; the soul has transcended their area of jurisdiction. For example, a pundit unites a man and woman in wedlock by performing the marriage ceremony. Once the ceremony is over, he says, “You are now husband and wife; I am leaving.” His task is over. If the wife says, “Punditji, the vows you made us take during the marriage ceremony are not being followed by my husband, the pundit will reply, “That is not my area of expertise. My duty was to get you both united in marriage and that work is over.” Similarly the Vedas are there to help unite the self with the Supreme Self. When God-realization takes place, the task of the Vedas is over. Such an enlightened soul is no longer obliged to perform the Vedic duties.",only given desires external objects rejoice satisfied self the root bondage material desires this happen not happen shree krishna explains little ahead chapter verse desire cause sins consequently must renounced as explained previously purport verse must borne mind whenever shree krishna says give desire refers material desires not aspirations spiritual progress desire realize godhowever material desires arise first place when identify self body identify yearnings body mind desires self send us spinning realm maya sage tulsidas explains jiba jiba te hari te bilagāno taba te deha geha nija mānyo māyā basa swarūp bisarāyo tehi brama te dāruṇa duḥkh pāyo when soul separated god material energy covered illusion by virtue illusion began thinking body ever since forgetfulness self experiencing immense misery those illumined realize self not material nature divine hence imperishable the perishable objects world never fulfill thirst imperishable soul therefore folly hanker senseobjects thus selfillumined souls learn unite consciousness god experience infinite bliss within themthe karm duties prescribed materially conditioned souls longer applicable illumined souls already attained goal karm for example long one college student one obliged follow rules university one graduated earned degree rules become irrelevant for liberated souls said brahmavit śhruti mūrdhnī those united god walk head vedas ie need follow rules vedas longerthe goal vedas help unite soul god once soul becomes godrealized rules vedas helped soul reach destination longer apply soul transcended area jurisdiction for example pundit unites man woman wedlock performing marriage ceremony once ceremony says you husband wife i leaving his task if wife says punditji vows made us take marriage ceremony not followed husband pundit reply that not area expertise my duty get united marriage work over similarly vedas help unite self supreme self when godrealization takes place task vedas such enlightened soul longer obliged perform vedic duties
3,18,नैव तस्य कृतेनार्थो नाकृतेनेह कश्चन | न चास्य सर्वभूतेषु कश्चिदर्थव्यपाश्रय: ॥18॥,"For him there is no concern here at all with performing action; nor any (concern) with non-performance. Moreover, for him there is no dependence on any object to serve any purpose.","These self-realized personalities are situated on the transcendental platform of the soul. Their every activity is transcendental, in service of God. So the duties prescribed for worldly people at the bodily level, in accordance with the Varṇāśhram Dharma, no longer apply to them.Here, the distinction needs to be made between karm and bhakti. Previously, Shree Krishna was talking about karm, (or prescribed worldly duties) and saying that they must be done as an offering to God. This was necessary to purify the mind, helping it rise above worldly contamination. But self-realized souls have already reached absorption in God and developed purity of mind. These transcendentalists are directly engaged in bhakti, or pure spiritual activities, such as meditation, worship, kīrtan, service to the Guru, etc. If such souls reject their worldly duties, it is not considered a sin. They may continue to perform worldly duties if they wish, but they are not obliged to do them.Historically, Saints have been of two kinds. 1) Those like Prahlad, Dhruv, Ambarish, Prithu, and Vibheeshan, who continued to discharge their worldly duties even after attaining the transcendental platform. These were the karm yogis—externally they were doing their duties with their body while internally their minds were attached to God. 2) Those like Shankaracharya, Madhvacharya, Ramanujacharya, and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, who rejected their worldly duties and accepted the renounced order of life. These were the karm sanyāsīs, who were both internally and externally, with both body and mind, engaged only in devotion to God. In this verse, Shree Krishna tells Arjun that both options exist for the self-realized sage. Now, he states this in the next verse which of these he recommends to Arjun.",these selfrealized personalities situated transcendental platform soul their every activity transcendental service god so duties prescribed worldly people bodily level accordance varṇāśhram dharma longer apply themhere distinction needs made karm bhakti previously shree krishna talking karm prescribed worldly duties saying must done offering god this necessary purify mind helping rise worldly contamination but selfrealized souls already reached absorption god developed purity mind these transcendentalists directly engaged bhakti pure spiritual activities meditation worship kīrtan service guru etc if souls reject worldly duties not considered sin they may continue perform worldly duties wish not obliged themhistorically saints two kinds those like prahlad dhruv ambarish prithu vibheeshan continued discharge worldly duties even attaining transcendental platform these karm duties body internally minds attached god those like shankaracharya madhvacharya ramanujacharya chaitanya mahaprabhu rejected worldly duties accepted renounced order life these karm sanyāsīs internally externally body mind engaged devotion god in verse shree krishna tells arjun options exist selfrealized sage now states next verse recommends arjun

In verses 3.17 and 3.18, he stated that the transcendentalist is not obliged to perform prescribed duties. So, what path is more suitable for Arjun? Shree Krishna’s recommendation for him is to be a karm yogi, and not take karm sanyās. He explains the reason for this in verses 3.20 to 3.26.",from verses shree krishna strongly urged not yet reached transcendental platform perform prescribed duties in verses stated transcendentalist not obliged perform prescribed duties so path suitable arjun shree krishna recommendation karm yogi not take karm sanyās he explains reason verses

Even after reaching the transcendental platform, he continued to do his worldly duties, purely for the reason that it would set a good example for the world to follow. Many other Saints did the same.Humanity is inspired by the ideals that they see in the lives of great people. Such leaders inspire society by their example and become shining beacons for the masses to follow. Leaders of society thus have a moral responsibility to set lofty examples for inspiring the rest of the population by their words, deeds, and character. When noble leaders are in the forefront, the rest of society naturally gets uplifted in morality, selflessness, and spiritual strength. But in times when there is a vacuum of principled leadership, the rest of society has no standards to pursue and slumps into self-centeredness, moral bankruptcy, and spiritual lassitude. Hence, great personalities should always act in an exemplary manner to set the standard for the world. Even though they themselves may have risen to the transcendental platform, and may not need to perform prescribed Vedic duties, by doing so, they inspire others to perform prescribed Vedic actions.If a great leader of society becomes a karm sanyāsī, and renounces work, it sets an errant precedent for others. The leader may be at the transcendental platform and therefore eligible to renounce work and engage completely in spirituality. However, others in society use their example as an excuse for escapism, to run away from their responsibilities. Such escapists cite the instances of the great karm sanyāsīs, such as Shankaracharya, Madhvacharya, Nimbarkacharya, and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Following their lofty footsteps, these imposters also renounce worldly duties and take sanyās, even though they have not yet attained the purity of mind required for it. In India, we find thousands of such sadhus. They copy the examples of the great sanyāsīs and don the ochre robes, without the concurrent internal enlightenment and bliss. Though externally renounced, their nature forces them to seek happiness, and devoid of the divine bliss of God, they begin indulging in the lowly pleasure of intoxication. Thus, they slip even below the level of people in household life, as stated in the following verse:brahma jñāna jānyo nahīṅ, karm diye chhiṭakāya,tulasī aisī ātmā sahaja naraka mahñ jāya. [v15]Sage Tulsidas says: “One who renounces worldly duties, without the concurrent internal enlightenment with divine knowledge, treads the quick path to hell.”Instead, if a great leader is a karm yogi, at least the followers will continue to do their karm and dutifully perform their responsibilities. This will help them learn to discipline their mind and senses, and slowly rise to the transcendental platform. Hence, to present an example for society to follow, Shree Krishna suggests that Arjun should practice karm yog.

(Still) I continue in action.","The reason why we all work is because we need something. We are all tiny parts of God, who is an ocean of bliss, and hence we all seek bliss. Since, we have not attained perfect bliss as yet, we feel dissatisfied and incomplete. So whatever we do is for the sake of attaining bliss. However, bliss is one of God’s energies and he alone possesses it to the infinite extent. He is perfect and complete in himself and has no need of anything outside of himself. Thus, he is also called Ātmārām (one who rejoices in the self), Ātma-ratī (one who is attracted to his or her own self), and Ātma-krīḍa (one who performs divine pastimes with his or her own self).If such a personality does work, there can be only one reason for it—it will not be for oneself, rather for the welfare of others. Thus, Shree Krishna tells Arjun that although in his personal form as Shree Krishna, he has no duty to perform in the universe, yet he works for the welfare of others. He next explains the welfare that is accomplished when he works.",the reason work need something we tiny parts god ocean bliss hence seek bliss since not attained perfect bliss yet feel dissatisfied incomplete so whatever sake attaining bliss however bliss one god energies alone possesses infinite extent he perfect complete need anything outside thus also called ātmārām one rejoices self ātmaratī one attracted self ātmakrīḍa one performs divine pastimes self if personality work one reason not oneself rather welfare others thus shree krishna tells arjun although personal form shree krishna duty perform universe yet works welfare others he next explains welfare accomplished works

If he had acted otherwise, other human beings would begin to imitate him, thinking that they must copy the conduct of the worthy son of the righteous King Vasudev. Had Shree Krishna failed to perform Vedic duties, human beings following his example would be led away from the discipline of karm, into a state of chaos. This would have been a very serious offence and Lord Krishna would be considered at fault. Thus, he explains to Arjun that if he did not fulfill his occupational duties, it would cause pandemonium in society.Similarly, Arjun was world-famous for being undefeated in battle, and was the brother of the virtuous King Yudhisthir. If Arjun refused to fulfill his duty to protect dharma, then many other worthy and noble warriors could follow his example and also renounce their prescribed duty of protecting righteousness. This would bring destruction to the world balance and the rout of innocent and virtuous people.

They are called ignorant because though they have bookish knowledge of the scriptures, they do not comprehend the final goal of God-realization. Such ignorant people perform their duty scrupulously according to the ordinance of the scriptures, without indolence or doubt. They have firm faith that the performance of Vedic duties and rituals will bring the material rewards they desire. If the faith of such people in rituals is broken, without their having developed faith in the higher principle of devotion, they will have nowhere to go. The Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam states:tāvat karmāṇi kurvīta na nirvidyeta yāvatāmat-kathā-śhravaṇādau vā śhraddhā yāvan na jāyate (11.20.9)[v16]“One should continue to perform karm as long as one has not developed renunciation from the sense objects and attachment to God.”Shree Krishna urges Arjun that just as ignorant people faithfully perform ritualistic duties, so also the wise should perform their works dutifully, not for material rewards, but for setting an ideal for the rest of society. Besides, the particular situation in which Arjun finds himself is a dharma yuddha (war of righteousness). Thus, for the welfare of society, Arjun should perform his duty as a warrior.",previously verse shree krishna used expression lokasaṅgraham evāpi sampaśhyan meaning view welfare masses in verse expression lokasaṅgraham chikīrṣhuḥ means wishing welfare world thus shree krishna emphasizes wise always act benefit humankindalso verse expression saktāḥ avidvānsaḥ used people yet bodily consciousness hence attached worldly pleasures full faith vedic rituals sanctioned scriptures they called ignorant though bookish knowledge scriptures not comprehend final goal godrealization such ignorant people perform duty scrupulously according ordinance scriptures without indolence doubt they firm faith performance vedic duties rituals bring material rewards desire if faith people rituals broken without developed faith higher principle devotion nowhere go the śhrīmad bhāgavatam states tāvat karmāṇi kurvīta na nirvidyeta yāvatāmatkathāśhravaṇādau vā śhraddhā yāvan na jāyate one continue perform karm long one not developed renunciation sense objects attachment god shree krishna urges arjun ignorant people faithfully perform ritualistic duties also wise perform works dutifully not material rewards setting ideal rest society besides particular situation arjun finds dharma yuddha war righteousness thus welfare society arjun perform duty warrior

Working, while himself remaining diligent, he should make them do all the duties.","Great persons have greater responsibility because common people follow them. So Shree Krishna urges that wise people should not perform any actions or make any utterances that lead the ignorant toward downfall. It may be argued that if the wise feel compassion for the ignorant, they should give them the highest knowledge—the knowledge of God-realization. Lord Krishna neutralizes this argument by stating na buddhi-bhedaṁ janayet, meaning the ignorant should not be asked to abandon duties by giving superior instructions they are not qualified to understand.Usually, people in material consciousness consider only two options. Either they are willing to work hard for fruitive results or they wish to give up all exertions on the plea that all works are laborious, painful, and wrought with evil. Between these, working for results is far superior to the escapist approach. Hence, the spiritually wise in Vedic knowledge should inspire the ignorant to perform their duties with attentiveness and care. If the minds of the ignorant become disturbed and unsettled then they may lose faith in working altogether, and with actions stopped and knowledge not arising, the ignorant will lose out from both sides.If both the ignorant and the wise perform Vedic actions, then what is the difference between them? Apprehending such a question, Shree Krishna explains this in the next two verses.",great persons greater responsibility common people follow so shree krishna urges wise people not perform actions make utterances lead ignorant toward downfall it may argued wise feel compassion ignorant give highest knowledge godrealization lord krishna neutralizes argument stating na buddhibhedaṁ janayet meaning ignorant not asked abandon duties giving superior instructions not qualified understandusually people material consciousness consider two options either willing work hard fruitive results wish give exertions plea works laborious painful wrought evil between working results far superior escapist approach hence spiritually wise vedic knowledge inspire ignorant perform duties attentiveness care if minds ignorant become disturbed unsettled may lose faith working altogether actions stopped knowledge not arising ignorant lose sidesif ignorant wise perform vedic actions difference apprehending question shree krishna explains next two verses
3,27,प्रकृते: क्रियमाणानि गुणै: कर्माणि सर्वश: | अहङ्कारविमूढात्मा कर्ताहमिति मन्यते ॥27॥,"While actions are being done in every way by the gunas (qualities) of Nature, one who is deluded by egoism thinks thus: 'I am the doer.'","We can see that the natural phenomena of the world are not directed by us, but are performed by prakṛiti, or Mother Nature. Now, for the actions of our own body, we usually divide them into two categories: 1) Natural biological functions, such as digestion, blood circulation, heartbeat, etc., which we do not consciously execute but which occur naturally. 2) Actions such as speaking, hearing, walking, sleeping, working etc. that we think we perform.Both these categories of works are performed by the mind-body-senses mechanism. All the parts of this mechanism are made from prakṛiti, or the material energy, which consists of the three modes (guṇas)—goodness (sattva), passion (rajas), and ignorance (tamas). Just as waves are not separate from the ocean, but a part of it, similarly the body is a part of Mother Nature from which it is created. Hence, material energy is the doer of everything.Why then does the soul perceive itself to be doing activities? The reason is that, in the grip of the unforgiving ego, the soul falsely identifies itself with the body. Hence, it remains under the illusion of doership. Let us say there are two trains standing side-by-side on the railway platform, and a passenger on one train fixes his gaze on the other. When the second train moves, it seems that the first is moving. Likewise the immobile soul identifies with the mobility of prakṛiti. Thus, it perceives itself as the doer of actions. The moment the soul eliminates the ego and surrenders to the will of God, it realizes itself as the non-doer.One may question that if the soul is truly the non-doer, then why is it implicated in law of karma for actions performed by the body? The reason is that the soul does not itself perform actions, but it does direct the actions of the senses-mind-intellect. For example, a chariot driver does not pull the chariot himself, but he does direct the horses. Now, if there is any accident, it is not the horses that are blamed, but the driver who was directing them. Similarly, the soul is held responsible for the actions of the mind-body mechanism because the senses-mind-intellect work on receiving inspiration from the soul.",we see natural phenomena world not directed us performed prakṛiti mother nature now actions body usually divide two categories natural biological functions digestion blood circulation heartbeat etc not consciously execute occur naturally actions speaking hearing walking sleeping working etc think performboth categories works performed mindbodysenses mechanism all parts mechanism made prakṛiti material energy consists three modes guṇas sattva passion rajas ignorance tamas just waves not separate ocean part similarly body part mother nature created hence material energy doer everythingwhy soul perceive activities the reason grip unforgiving ego soul falsely identifies body hence remains illusion doership let us say two trains standing sidebyside railway platform passenger one train fixes gaze when second train moves seems first moving likewise immobile soul identifies mobility prakṛiti thus perceives doer actions the moment soul eliminates ego surrenders god realizes nondoerone may question soul truly nondoer implicated law karma actions performed body the reason soul not perform actions direct actions sensesmindintellect for example chariot driver not pull chariot direct horses now accident not horses blamed driver directing similarly soul held responsible actions mindbody mechanism sensesmindintellect work receiving inspiration soul

This verse talks about the tattva-vit, or the knowers of the Truth. Having thus abolished the ego, they are free from bodily identifications, and are able to discern their spiritual identity distinct from the corporeal body. Hence, they are not beguiled into thinking of themselves as the doers of their material actions, and instead they attribute every activity to the movements of the three guṇas. Such God-realized Saints say: jo karai so hari karai, hota kabīr kabīr [v17] “God is doing everything, but people are thinking that I am doing.”",the previous verse mentioned ahankāra vimūḍhātmā bewildered ego misidentify body think doers this verse talks tattvavit knowers truth having thus abolished ego free bodily identifications able discern spiritual identity distinct corporeal body hence not beguiled thinking doers material actions instead attribute every activity movements three guṇas such godrealized saints say jo karai hari karai hota kabīr kabīr god everything people thinking i

The knower of the All should not disturb those of dull intellect, who do not know the All.","The question may be raised that if soul is distinct from the guṇas and their activities, then why are the ignorant attached to sense objects? Shree Krishna explains in this verse that they become bewildered by the guṇas of the material energy, and think themselves to be the doers. Infatuated by the three modes of material nature, they work for the express purpose of being able to enjoy sensual and mental delights. They are unable to perform actions as a matter of duty, without desiring rewards.However, the kṛitsna-vit (persons with knowledge) should not disturb the minds of the akṛitsna-vit (persons without knowledge). This means that the wise should not force their thoughts onto ignorant persons by saying, “You are the soul, not the body, and hence karm is meaningless; give it up.” Rather, they should instruct the ignorant to perform their respective karm, and slowly help them rise above attachment. In this way, after presenting the distinctions between those who are spiritually wise and those who are ignorant, Shree Krishna gives the sober caution not to unsettle the minds of the ignorant.",the question may raised soul distinct guṇas activities ignorant attached sense objects shree krishna explains verse become bewildered guṇas material energy think doers infatuated three modes material nature work express purpose able enjoy sensual mental delights they unable perform actions matter duty without desiring rewardshowever kṛitsnavit persons knowledge not disturb minds akṛitsnavit persons without knowledge this means wise not force thoughts onto ignorant persons saying you soul not body hence karm meaningless give up rather instruct ignorant perform respective karm slowly help rise attachment in way presenting distinctions spiritually wise ignorant shree krishna gives sober caution not unsettle minds ignorant

The words adhyātma chetasā mean “with the thoughts resting on God.” Sanyasya means “renouncing all activities that are not dedicated to him.” Nirāśhīḥ means “without hankering for the results of the actions.” The consciousness of dedicating all actions to God requires forsaking claim to proprietorship, and renouncing all desire for personal gain, hankering, and lamentation.The summary of the instructions in the previous verses is that one should very faithfully reflect, “My soul is a tiny part of the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna. He is the Enjoyer and Master of all. All my works are meant for his pleasure, and thus, I should perform my duties in the spirit of yajña or sacrifice to him. He supplies the energy by which I accomplish works of yajña.

An opinion is a personal view, while a principle is universal fact. Opinions can differ amongst teachers, but the principle is the same. Philosophers and teachers name their opinion as principle, but in the Gita, the Lord has named the principle explained by him as opinion. By his example, he is teaching us humility and cordiality.Having given the call for action, Shree Krishna now points out the virtues of accepting the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita with faith and following them in one’s life. Our prerogative as humans is to know the truth and then modify our lives accordingly. In this way, our mental fever (of lust, anger, greed, envy, illusion, etc.) gets pacified.In the previous verse, Shree Krishna had clearly explained to Arjun to offer all works to him. But he knows that this statement can cause ridicule from those who have no belief in God and rebuke from those who are envious of him. So, he now emphasizes the need for accepting the teachings with conviction. He says that by faithfully following these teachings one becomes free from the bondage of karma. But what happens to those who are faithless?

3,32,ये त्वेतदभ्यसूयन्तो नानुतिष्ठन्ति मे मतम् | सर्वज्ञानविमूढांस्तान्विद्धि नष्टानचेतस: ॥32॥,"But those who, decaying [Finding fault where there is none.] this, do not follow My teaching, know them-who are deluded about all knowledge [Knowledge concerning the qualified and the un-qualified Brahman.] and who are devoid of discrimination-to have gone to ruin.","The teachings presented by Shree Krishna are perfect for our eternal welfare. However, our material intellect has innumerable imperfections, and so we are not always able to comprehend the sublimity of his teachings or appreciate their benefits. If we could, what would be the difference between us tiny souls and the Supreme Divine Personality? Thus, faith becomes a necessary ingredient for accepting the divine teachings of the Bhagavad Gita. Wherever our intellect is unable to comprehend, rather than finding fault with the teachings, we must submit our intellect, “Shree Krishna has said it. There must be veracity in it, which I cannot understand at present. Let me accept it for now and engage in spiritual sādhanā. I will be able to comprehend it in future, when I progress in spirituality through sādhanā.” This attitude is called śhraddhā, or faith.Jagadguru Shankaracharaya defines śhraddhā as: guru vedānta vākyeṣhu dṛiḍho viśhvāsaḥ śhraddhā [v18]“Śhraddhā is strong faith in the words of the Guru and the scriptures.”Chaitanya Mahaprabhu explained it similarly: śhraddhā śhabde viśhwāsa kahe sudṛiḍha niśhchaya (Chaitanya Charitāmṛit, Madhya Leela, 22.62)[v19] “The word Śhraddhā means strong faith in God and Guru, even though we may not comprehend their message at present.”The British poet, Alfred Tennyson said: “By faith alone, embrace believing, where we cannot prove.” So, śhraddhā means earnestly digesting the comprehensible portions of the Bhagavad Gita, and also accepting the abstruse portions, with the hope that they will become comprehensible in future.However, one of the persistent defects of the material intellect is pride. Due to pride, whatever the intellect cannot comprehend at present, it often rejects as incorrect. Though Shree Krishna’s teachings are presented by the omniscient Lord for the welfare of the souls, people still find fault in them, such as, “Why is God asking everything to be offered to him? Is he greedy? Is he an egotist that he asks Arjun to worship him?” Shree Krishna says that such people are achetasaḥ, or “devoid of discrimination,” because they cannot distinguish between the pure and the impure, the righteous and the unrighteous, the Creator and the created, the Supreme Master and the servant. Such people “bring about their own ruin,” because they reject the path to eternal salvation and keep rotating in the cycle of life and death.",the teachings presented shree krishna perfect eternal welfare however material intellect innumerable imperfections not always able comprehend sublimity teachings appreciate benefits if could would difference us tiny souls supreme divine personality thus faith becomes necessary ingredient accepting divine teachings bhagavad gita wherever intellect unable comprehend rather finding fault teachings must submit intellect shree krishna said there must veracity i not understand present let accept engage spiritual sādhanā i able comprehend future i progress spirituality sādhanā this attitude called śhraddhā faithjagadguru shankaracharaya defines śhraddhā guru vedānta vākyeṣhu dṛiḍho viśhvāsaḥ śhraddhā śhraddhā strong faith words guru scriptures chaitanya mahaprabhu explained similarly śhraddhā śhabde viśhwāsa kahe sudṛiḍha niśhchaya chaitanya charitāmṛit madhya leela the word śhraddhā means strong faith god guru even though may not comprehend message present the british poet alfred tennyson said by faith alone embrace believing not prove so śhraddhā means earnestly digesting comprehensible portions bhagavad gita also accepting abstruse portions hope become comprehensible futurehowever one persistent defects material intellect pride due pride whatever intellect not comprehend present often rejects incorrect though shree krishna teachings presented omniscient lord welfare souls people still find fault why god asking everything offered is greedy is egotist asks arjun worship shree krishna says people achetasaḥ devoid discrimination not distinguish pure impure righteous unrighteous creator created supreme master servant such people bring ruin reject path eternal salvation keep rotating cycle life death
3,33,सदृशं चेष्टते स्वस्या: प्रकृतेर्ज्ञानवानपि | प्रकृतिं यान्ति भूतानि निग्रह: किं करिष्यति ॥33॥,Even a man of wisdom behaves according to his own nature. Beings follow (their) nature. What can restraint do?,"Shree Krishna again comes back to the point about action being superior to inaction. Propelled by their natures, people are inclined to act in accordance with their individual modes. Even those who are theoretically learned carry with them the baggage of the sanskārs (tendencies and impressions) of endless past lives, the prārabdh karma of this life, and the individual traits of their minds and intellects. They find it difficult to resist this force of habit and nature. If the Vedic scriptures instructed them to give up all works and engage in pure spirituality, it would create an unstable situation. Such artificial repression would be counter-productive. The proper and easier way for spiritual advancement is to utilize the immense force of habit and tendencies and dovetail it in the direction of God. We have to begin the spiritual ascent from where we stand, and doing so requires we have to first accept our present condition of what we are and then improve on it.We can see how even animals act according to their unique natures. Ants are such social creatures that they bring food for the community while forsaking it themselves, a quality that is difficult to find in human society. A cow has such intense attachment for its calf that the moment it goes out of its sight, the cow feels disturbed. Dogs display the virtue of loyalty to depths that cannot be matched by the best of humans. Similarly, we humans too are propelled by our natures. Since Arjun was a warrior by nature, Shree Krishna told him, “If, motivated by pride, you think, “I shall not fight,” your decision will be in vain. Your own nature will compel you to fight.” (Bhagavad Gita 18.59) “O Arjun, that action which out of delusion you do not wish to do, you will be driven to do it by your own inclination, born of your own material nature.” (Bhagavad Gita 18.60) That nature should be sublimated by shifting the goal from worldly enjoyment to God-realization, and performing our prescribed duty without attachment and aversion, in the spirit of service to God.",shree krishna comes back point action superior inaction propelled natures people inclined act accordance individual modes even theoretically learned carry baggage sanskārs tendencies impressions endless past lives prārabdh karma life individual traits minds intellects they find difficult resist force habit nature if vedic scriptures instructed give works engage pure spirituality would create unstable situation such artificial repression would counterproductive the proper easier way spiritual advancement utilize immense force habit tendencies dovetail direction god we begin spiritual ascent stand requires first accept present condition improve itwe see even animals act according unique natures ants social creatures bring food community forsaking quality difficult find human society a cow intense attachment calf moment goes sight cow feels disturbed dogs display virtue loyalty depths not matched best humans similarly humans propelled natures since arjun warrior nature shree krishna told if motivated pride think i shall not fight decision vain your nature compel fight bhagavad gita o arjun action delusion not wish driven inclination born material nature bhagavad gita that nature sublimated shifting goal worldly enjoyment godrealization performing prescribed duty without attachment aversion spirit service god
3,34,इन्द्रियस्येन्द्रियस्यार्थे रागद्वेषौ व्यवस्थितौ | तयोर्न वशमागच्छेत्तौ ह्यस्य परिपन्थिनौ ॥34॥,"Attraction and repulsion are ordained with regard to the objects of all the organs. One should not come under the sway of these two, because they are his adversaries.","Although Shree Krishna previously emphasized that the mind and senses are propelled by their natural tendencies, he now opens up the possibility of harnessing them. As long as we have the material body, for its maintenance, we have to utilize the objects of the senses. Shree Krishna is not asking us to stop consuming what is necessary, but to practice eradicating attachment and aversion. Definitely sanskārs (past life tendencies) do have a deep-rooted influence on all living beings, but if we practice the method taught in the Bhagavad Gita, we can succeed in correcting the situation.The senses naturally run toward the sense objects and their mutual interaction creates sensations of pleasure and pain. For example, the taste buds experience joy in contact with delicious foods and distress in contact with bitter foods. The mind repeatedly contemplates the sensations of pleasure and pain which it associates with these objects. Thoughts of pleasure in the sense objects create attachment while thoughts of pain create aversion. Shree Krishna tells Arjun to succumb neither to feelings of attachment nor aversion.In the discharge of our worldly duty, we will have to encounter all kinds of likeable and unlikeable situations. We must practice neither to yearn for the likeable situations, nor to avoid the unlikeable situations. When we stop being slaves of both the likes and dislikes of the mind and senses, we will overcome our lower nature. And when we become indifferent to both pleasure and pain in the discharge of our duty, we will become truly free to act from our higher nature.",although shree krishna previously emphasized mind senses propelled natural tendencies opens possibility harnessing as long material body maintenance utilize objects senses shree krishna not asking us stop consuming necessary practice eradicating attachment aversion definitely sanskārs past life tendencies deeprooted influence living beings practice method taught bhagavad gita succeed correcting situationthe senses naturally run toward sense objects mutual interaction creates sensations pleasure pain for example taste buds experience joy contact delicious foods distress contact bitter foods the mind repeatedly contemplates sensations pleasure pain associates objects thoughts pleasure sense objects create attachment thoughts pain create aversion shree krishna tells arjun succumb neither feelings attachment aversionin discharge worldly duty encounter kinds likeable unlikeable situations we must practice neither yearn likeable situations avoid unlikeable situations when stop slaves likes dislikes mind senses overcome lower nature and become indifferent pleasure pain discharge duty become truly free act higher nature
3,35,श्रेयान्स्वधर्मो विगुण: परधर्मात्स्वनुष्ठितात् | स्वधर्मे निधनं श्रेय: परधर्मो भयावह: ॥35॥,"One's own duty [Customary or scripturally ordained observances of different castes and sects.], though defective, is superior to another's duty well-performed. Death is better while engaged in one's own duty; another's duty is fraught with fear.","In this verse, the word dharma has been used four times. Dharma is a word commonly used in Hinduism and Buddhism. But it is the most elusive word to translate into the English language. Terms like righteousness, good conduct, duty, noble quality, etc. only describe an aspect of its meaning. Dharma comes from the root word dhṛi, which means ḍhāraṇ karane yogya, or “responsibilities, duties, thoughts, and actions that are appropriate for us.” For example, the dharma of the soul is to love God. It is like the central law of our being.The prefix swa means “the self.” Thus, swa-dharma is our personal dharma, which is the dharma applicable to our context, situation, maturity, and profession in life. This swa-dharma can change as our context in life changes, and as we grow spiritually. By asking Arjun to follow his swa-dharma, Shree Krishna is telling him to follow his profession, and not change it because someone else may be doing something else.It is more enjoyable to be ourselves than to pretend to be someone else. The duties born of our nature can be easily performed with stability of mind. The duties of others may seem attractive from a distance and we may think of switching, but that is a risky thing to do. If they conflict with our nature, they will create disharmony in our senses, mind, and intellect. This will be detrimental for our consciousness and will hinder our progress on the spiritual path. Shree Krishna emphasizes this point dramatically by saying that it is better to die in the faithful performance of one’s duty than to be in the unnatural position of doing another’s duty.",in verse word dharma used four times dharma word commonly used hinduism buddhism but elusive word translate english language terms like righteousness good conduct duty noble quality etc describe aspect meaning dharma comes root word dhṛi means ḍhāraṇ karane yogya responsibilities duties thoughts actions appropriate us for example dharma soul love god it like central law beingthe prefix swa means self thus swadharma personal dharma dharma applicable context situation maturity profession life this swadharma change context life changes grow spiritually by asking arjun follow swadharma shree krishna telling follow profession not change someone else may something elseit enjoyable pretend someone else the duties born nature easily performed stability mind the duties others may seem attractive distance may think switching risky thing if conflict nature create disharmony senses mind intellect this detrimental consciousness hinder progress spiritual path shree krishna emphasizes point dramatically saying better die faithful performance one duty unnatural position another duty

Arjun wishes to lead such a divine life, but finds the advice difficult to implement. So he asks Shree Krishna a question that is very realistic and representative of the human struggle. He says, “What force prevents us from reaching this high ideal? What makes one succumb to attachment and aversion?”We all have a conscience that makes us feel remorseful while committing a sin. The conscience is grounded in the fact that God is the abode of virtue, and as his fragments, we all have an innate attraction for virtue and goodness. The goodness that is the nature of the soul gives rise to the voice of conscience. Thus, we cannot make the excuse that we did not know stealing, swindling, libel, extortion, murder, oppression, and corruption are sinful activities. We intuitively know these deeds to be sinful, and yet we commit such acts, as if some strong force impels to do them. Arjun wishes to know what that strong force is.",shree krishna stated previous verse one not come influence attraction aversion arjun wishes lead divine life finds advice difficult implement so asks shree krishna question realistic representative human struggle he says what force prevents us reaching high ideal what makes one succumb attachment aversion we conscience makes us feel remorseful committing sin the conscience grounded fact god abode virtue fragments innate attraction virtue goodness the goodness nature soul gives rise voice conscience thus not make excuse not know stealing swindling libel extortion murder oppression corruption sinful activities we intuitively know deeds sinful yet commit acts strong force impels arjun wishes know strong force
3,37,श्रीभगवानुवाच | काम एष क्रोध एष रजोगुणसमुद्भव: || महाशनो महापाप्मा विद्ध्येनमिह वैरिणम् ॥37॥,"The Blessed Lord said: This desire, this anger, born of the guna of rajas, is a great devourer, a great sinner. Know this to be the enemy here.","The Vedas use the word kām, or lust, not only for sexual desires but also to include all desires for material enjoyment based on the bodily concept of the self. Thus, lust shows itself in many ways—the urge for money, physical cravings, craving for prestige, the drive for power, etc. This lust is only a perverted reflection of love for God, which is the inherent nature of every living being. When the soul associates with the material energy in the form of the body, its divine love for God is transformed into lust, in association with the mode of passion. Since divine love is the highest power of God, its perversion in the material realm, which is lust, is also the most powerful force in worldly activities.Shree Krishna identifies this “lust” for worldly enjoyment as the cause of sin, as the malignant allure sitting within us. The mode of passion deludes the soul into believing that worldly objects will give satisfaction, and so one creates desires for acquiring them. When desire is satisfied, it gives birth to greed; when it is not satisfied, it gives rise to anger. One commits sins under the influence of all three—lust, greed, and anger. Greed is nothing but intensified desire, while anger is frustrated desire. Hence, Shree Krishna labels lust, or desire, as the root of all evil.",the vedas use word kām lust not sexual desires also include desires material enjoyment based bodily concept self thus lust shows many urge money physical cravings craving prestige drive power etc this lust perverted reflection love god inherent nature every living when soul associates material energy form body divine love god transformed lust association mode passion since divine love highest power god perversion material realm lust also powerful force worldly activitiesshree krishna identifies lust worldly enjoyment cause sin malignant allure sitting within us the mode passion deludes soul believing worldly objects give satisfaction one creates desires acquiring when desire satisfied gives birth greed not satisfied gives rise anger one commits sins influence greed anger greed nothing intensified desire anger frustrated desire hence shree krishna labels lust desire root evil
3,38,धूमेनाव्रियते वह्निर्यथादर्शो मलेन च | यथोल्बेनावृतो गर्भस्तथा तेनेदमावृतम् ॥38॥,"As fire is enveloped by smoke, as a mirror by dirt, and as a foetus remains enclosed in the womb, so in this shrouded by that.","Knowledge of what is right and what is wrong is called discrimination. This discrimination resides in the intellect. However, lust is such a formidable adversary that it clouds the discriminatory ability of the intellect. Shree Krishna gives three grades of examples to illustrate this principle. Fire, which is the source of light, gets covered by smoke. This partial obscuring is like the thin cloud that sāttvic desires create. A mirror, which is naturally reflective, gets obscured by dust. This semi-opacity is like the masking impact of rājasic desires on the intellect. And an embryo gets concealed in the womb. This complete obfuscation is like the consequence of tāmasic desires subverting the power of discrimination. Similarly, in proportion to the grade of our desires, the spiritual knowledge we may have heard and read gets shrouded.There is a beautiful allegorical story to illustrate this point. A man used to take his evening walk by the side of a forest. One evening, he decided to walk in the forest instead. When he had walked a couple of miles, the sun began setting and the light started fading. He turned around to walk out of the forest, but to his dismay he found that animals had gathered on the other side. These ferocious animals started chasing him and to escape from them, he ran deeper into the forest. While running, he found a witch standing in front of him with open arms to embrace him. To escape her, he turned direction and ran perpendicular to the animals and the witch. By then, it had become dark. Unable to see much, he ran over a ditch that was covered by vine hanging from a tree. He fell headlong, but his feet became entangled in the vine. As a result, he began hanging upside down above the ditch. After a few moments he came to his senses and saw a snake sitting at the bottom of the ditch, waiting to bite him if he fell down. In the meantime, two mice appeared—one white and one black—and started nibbling at the branch from which the vine was hanging. To confound his problems, some wasps gathered and began stinging him on his face. In this precarious situation, it was found that the man was smiling. Philosophers gathered to ponder how he could smile in such a dire strait. They looked upwards and found a beehive, from which honey was dripping onto his tongue. He was licking the honey and thinking how pleasurable it was; he had forgotten the animals, the witch, the snake, the mice, and the wasps.The person in the story may seem insane to us. However, this tale depicts the condition of all humans under the influence of desire. The forest in which the man was walking represents the material world in which we live, where there is danger at every step. The animals that chased him represent diseases that begin to appear in life, and continue harassing us until death. The witch represented old age that is waiting to embrace us with the passage of time. The snake at the bottom of the pit is like the inevitable death that awaits us all. The white and black mice that were nibbling on the branch represent day and night, which are steadily reducing our life and bringing us closer to death. The wasps that were stinging the face are like the innumerable desires that arise in the mind and agitate it, causing us pain and distress. Honey represents the sensual enjoyment we experience in the world, which clouds the discrimination of our intellect. Hence, forgetting our precarious position, we remain absorbed in enjoying the temporary delights of the senses. Shree Krishna states that it is this type of lustful desire that is responsible for shrouding our power of discrimination.",knowledge right wrong called discrimination this discrimination resides intellect however lust formidable adversary clouds discriminatory ability intellect shree krishna gives three grades examples illustrate principle fire source light gets covered smoke this partial obscuring like thin cloud sāttvic desires create a mirror naturally reflective gets obscured dust this semiopacity like masking impact rājasic desires intellect and embryo gets concealed womb this complete obfuscation like consequence tāmasic desires subverting power discrimination similarly proportion grade desires spiritual knowledge may heard read gets shroudedthere beautiful allegorical story illustrate point a man used take evening walk side forest one evening decided walk forest instead when walked couple miles sun began setting light started fading he turned around walk forest dismay found animals gathered side these ferocious animals started chasing escape ran deeper forest while running found witch standing front open arms embrace to escape turned direction ran perpendicular animals witch by become dark unable see much ran ditch covered vine hanging tree he fell headlong feet became entangled vine as result began hanging upside ditch after moments came senses saw snake sitting bottom ditch waiting bite fell in meantime two mice white one started nibbling branch vine hanging to confound problems wasps gathered began stinging face in precarious situation found man smiling philosophers gathered ponder could smile dire strait they looked upwards found beehive honey dripping onto tongue he licking honey thinking pleasurable forgotten animals witch snake mice waspsthe person story may seem insane us however tale depicts condition humans influence desire the forest man walking represents material world live danger every step the animals chased represent diseases begin appear life continue harassing us death the witch represented old age waiting embrace us passage time the snake bottom pit like inevitable death awaits us the white black mice nibbling branch represent day night steadily reducing life bringing us closer death the wasps stinging face like innumerable desires arise mind agitate causing us pain distress honey represents sensual enjoyment experience world clouds discrimination intellect hence forgetting precarious position remain absorbed enjoying temporary delights senses shree krishna states type lustful desire responsible shrouding power discrimination

However, the more they attempt to dowse the fire of desire, the more strongly it burns. The Buddha states:na kahāpaṇa vassena, titti kāmesu vijjatiappassādā kāmā dukhā kāmā, iti viññāya paṇḍito (Dhammapada verse 186) [v20]“Desire burns like an unquenchable fire, which never brings happiness to anyone.

In this verse, Shree Krishna states that the senses, mind, and intellect are the places from where lust exercises its dominion over the soul. Under the sway of lust, the sense objects are desired by the senses, the senses infatuate the mind, the mind misleads the intellect, and the intellect loses its discriminatory powers. When the intellect is clouded, the living being is deluded to become a slave of lust and will do anything to satiate it.These instruments—senses, mind, and intellect—are not bad in themselves. They were given to us for the purpose of achieving God-realization, but we have permitted lust in its many forms to lay siege on them. Now, we have to use the same senses, mind, and intellect to uplift ourselves.

Having identified the repositories of lust, Shree Krishna asks Arjun, at the outset, to curb the desires of the senses. Permitting them to arise is the cause of our miseries, while eliminating them is the way to peace.Consider the following example. Ramesh and Dinesh were two fellow students sharing the same room in the hostel. At 10 pm at night, Ramesh developed the desire to smoke cigarettes. He said, “I am getting the urge to smoke.” Dinesh replied, “It is so late at night. Forget about cigarettes and go to sleep.” “No…no…I will not be able to sleep until I puff the tobacco,” said Ramesh. Dinesh went to sleep, but Ramesh went out in search of cigarettes. The shops nearby had closed. It took him two hours until he finally returned to the hostel with the cigarette and had a smoke.In the morning, Dinesh asked him, “Ramesh, when did you sleep at night?” “At midnight.” “Really! That means you remained agitated for cigarettes for two hours and when you had your puffs, you returned to the same state that you were in at 10 pm.” “What do you mean by that?” asked Ramesh. “Look, at 10 pm you did not have any desire for cigarettes, and you were peaceful. Then you yourself created the desire for them. From 10 pm to midnight, you remained agitated for cigarettes. Finally, when you smoked them, the disease, which you had created, went away, and you got to sleep. I, on the other hand, did not create any desire, and slept peacefully at 10 pm itself.”In this way, we create desires for the objects of the senses of the body, and then become agitated by them.

However, the one who is superior to the intellect is He.","An inferior entity can be controlled by its superior entity. Shree Krishna explains the gradation of superiority amongst the instruments God has provided to us. He describes that the body is made of gross matter; superior to it are the five knowledge-bearing senses (which grasp the perceptions of taste, touch, sight, smell, and sound); beyond the senses is the mind; superior to the mind is the intellect, with its ability to discriminate; but even beyond the intellect is the divine soul.This knowledge of the sequence of superiority amongst the senses, mind, intellect, and soul, can now be used for rooting out lust, as explained in the final verse of this chapter.",an inferior entity controlled superior entity shree krishna explains gradation superiority amongst instruments god provided us he describes body made gross matter superior five knowledgebearing senses grasp perceptions taste touch sight smell sound beyond senses mind superior mind intellect ability discriminate even beyond intellect divine soulthis knowledge sequence superiority amongst senses mind intellect soul used rooting lust explained final verse chapter
3,43,एवं बुद्धे: परं बुद्ध्वा संस्तभ्यात्मानमात्मना | जहि शत्रुं महाबाहो कामरूपं दुरासदम् ॥43॥,"Understanding the Self thus [Understanding thus: that desires can be conquered through the knowledge of the Self.] as superior to the intellect, and completely establishing (the Self) is spiritual absorption with the (help of) the mind, O mighty-armed one, vanish the enemy in the form of desire, which is difficult to subdue.","In conclusion, Shree Krishna emphasizes that we should slay this enemy called lust through knowledge of the self. Since the soul is a part of God, it is divine in nature. Thus, the divine bliss it seeks can only be attained from a divine subject, while the objects of the world are all material. These material objects can never fulfill the innate longing of the soul and so it is futile to create desires for them. We must exert and train the intellect to think in this manner, and then use it to control the mind and the senses.This is explained very beautifully in the Kaṭhopaniṣhad with the help of the model of a chariot:ātmānagvaṁ rathinaṁ viddhi śharīraṁ rathameva tubuddhiṁ tu sārathiṁ viddhi manaḥ pragrahameva chaindriyāṇi hayānāhurviṣhayānsteṣhu gocharānātmendriyamanoyuktaṁ bhoktetyāhurmanīṣhiṇaḥ (1.3.3-4) [v21]The Upaniṣhads say there is a chariot, which has five horses pulling it; the horses have reins in their mouths, which are in the hands of a charioteer; a passenger is sitting at the back of the chariot. Ideally, the passenger should instruct the charioteer, who should then control the reins and guide the horses in the proper direction. However, in this case, the passenger has gone to sleep, and so the horses are holding sway.In this analogy, the chariot is the body, the horses are the five senses, the reins in the mouth of the horses is the mind, the charioteer is the intellect, and the passenger seated behind is the soul residing in the body. The senses (horses) desire pleasurable things. The mind (reins) is not exercising restraint on the senses (horses). The intellect (charioteer) submits to the pull of the reins (mind). So in the materially bound state, the bewildered soul does not direct the intellect in the proper direction. Thus, the senses decide the direction where the chariot will go. The soul experiences the pleasures of the senses vicariously, but these do not satisfy it. Seated on this chariot, the soul (passenger) is moving around in this material world since eternity.However, if the soul wakes up to its higher nature and decides to take a proactive role, it can exercise the intellect in the proper direction. The intellect will then govern the lower self—the mind and the senses—and the chariot will move in the direction of eternal welfare. In this way, the higher self (soul) must be used to control the lower self (senses, mind, and, intellect).",in conclusion shree krishna emphasizes slay enemy called lust knowledge self since soul part god divine nature thus divine bliss seeks attained divine subject objects world material these material objects never fulfill innate longing soul futile create desires we must exert train intellect think manner use control mind sensesthis explained beautifully kaṭhopaniṣhad help model chariot ātmānagvaṁ rathinaṁ viddhi śharīraṁ rathameva tubuddhiṁ tu sārathiṁ viddhi manaḥ pragrahameva chaindriyāṇi hayānāhurviṣhayānsteṣhu gocharānātmendriyamanoyuktaṁ bhoktetyāhurmanīṣhiṇaḥ the upaniṣhads say chariot five horses pulling horses reins mouths hands charioteer passenger sitting back chariot ideally passenger instruct charioteer control reins guide horses proper direction however case passenger gone sleep horses holding swayin analogy chariot body horses five senses reins mouth horses mind charioteer intellect passenger seated behind soul residing body the senses horses desire pleasurable things the mind reins not exercising restraint senses horses the intellect charioteer submits pull reins mind so materially bound state bewildered soul not direct intellect proper direction thus senses decide direction chariot go the soul experiences pleasures senses vicariously not satisfy seated chariot soul passenger moving around material world since eternityhowever soul wakes higher nature decides take proactive role exercise intellect proper direction the intellect govern lower mind chariot move direction eternal welfare in way higher self soul must used control lower self senses mind intellect
4,1,श्रीभगवानुवाच | इमं विवस्वते योगं प्रोक्तवानहमव्ययम् | विवस्वान्मनवे प्राह मनुरिक्ष्वाकवेऽब्रवीत् ॥1॥,"The Blessed Lord said: I imparted this imperishable Yoga to Vivasvan(Sun-God), Vivasvan taught this to Manu, and Manu transmitted this to Iksavaku.","Merely imparting invaluable knowledge to someone is not enough. The recipients of that knowledge must appreciate its value and have faith in its authenticity. Only then will they put in the effort required to implement it practically in their lives. In this verse, Shree Krishna establishes the credibility and importance of the spiritual wisdom he is bestowing on Arjun. Shree Krishna informs Arjun that the knowledge being imparted unto him is not newly created for the convenience of motivating him into battle. It is the same eternal science of Yog that he originally taught to Vivasvan, or Surya, Sun God, who imparted it to Manu, the original progenitor of humankind; Manu in turn taught it to Ikshvaku, first king of the Solar dynasty. This is the descending process of knowledge, where someone who is a perfect authority on the knowledge passes it down to another who wishes to know.In contrast to this is the ascending process of acquiring knowledge, where one endeavors to enhance the frontiers of understanding through self-effort. The ascending process is laborious, imperfect, and time-consuming. For example, if we wish to learn Physics, we could either try to do it by the ascending process, where we speculate about its principles with our own intellect and then reach conclusions, or we could do it by the descending process, where we approach a good teacher of the subject. The ascending process is exceedingly time-consuming, and we may not even be able to complete the inquiry in our lifetime. We can also not be sure about the validity of our conclusions. In comparison, the descending process gives us instant access to the deepest secrets of Physics. If our teacher has perfect knowledge of Physics, then it is very straightforward—simply listen to the science from him and digest what he says. This descending process of receiving knowledge is both easy and faultless.Every year, thousands of self-help books are released in the market, which present the authors’ solutions to the problems encountered in life. These books may be helpful in a limited way, but because they are based upon the ascending process of attaining knowledge, they are imperfect. Every few years, a new theory comes along that overthrows the current ones. This ascending process is unsuitable for knowing the Absolute Truth. Divine knowledge does not need to be created by self-effort. It is the energy of God, and has existed ever since he has existed, just as heat and light are as old as the fire from which they emanate.God and the individual soul are both eternal, and so the science of Yog that unites the soul and God is also eternal. There is no need to speculate and formulate new theories about it. An amazing endorsement of this truism is the Bhagavad Gita itself, which continues to astound people with the sagacity of its perennial wisdom that remains relevant to our daily lives even fifty centuries after it was spoken. Shree Krishna states here that the knowledge of Yog, which he is revealing to Arjun, is eternal and it was passed down in ancient times through the descending process, from Guru to disciple.",merely imparting invaluable knowledge someone not enough the recipients knowledge must appreciate value faith authenticity only put effort required implement practically lives in verse shree krishna establishes credibility importance spiritual wisdom bestowing arjun shree krishna informs arjun knowledge imparted unto not newly created convenience motivating battle it eternal science yog originally taught vivasvan surya sun god imparted manu original progenitor humankind manu turn taught ikshvaku first king solar dynasty this descending process knowledge someone perfect authority knowledge passes another wishes knowin contrast ascending process acquiring knowledge one endeavors enhance frontiers understanding selfeffort the ascending process laborious imperfect timeconsuming for example wish learn physics could either try ascending process speculate principles intellect reach conclusions could descending process approach good teacher subject the ascending process exceedingly timeconsuming may not even able complete inquiry lifetime we also not sure validity conclusions in comparison descending process gives us instant access deepest secrets physics if teacher perfect knowledge physics listen science digest says this descending process receiving knowledge easy faultlessevery year thousands selfhelp books released market present authors solutions problems encountered life these books may helpful limited way based upon ascending process attaining knowledge imperfect every years new theory comes along overthrows current ones this ascending process unsuitable knowing absolute truth divine knowledge not need created selfeffort it energy god existed ever since existed heat light old fire emanategod individual soul eternal science yog unites soul god also eternal there need speculate formulate new theories an amazing endorsement truism bhagavad gita continues astound people sagacity perennial wisdom remains relevant daily lives even fifty centuries spoken shree krishna states knowledge yog revealing arjun eternal passed ancient times descending process guru disciple
4,2,एवं परम्पराप्राप्तमिमं राजर्षयो विदु: | स कालेनेह महता योगो नष्ट: परन्तप ॥2॥,"The king-sages knew this (yoga) which was received thus in regular succession. That Yoga, O destroyer of foes, in now lost owing to a long lapse of time.","In the descending process of receiving divine knowledge, the disciple understands the science of God-realization from the Guru, who in turn received it from his Guru. It was in such a tradition that saintly kings like Nimi and Janak understood the science of Yog. This tradition starts from God himself, who is the first Guru of the world.tene brahma hṛidā ya ādi-kavaye muhyanti yat sūrayaḥ  (Bhāgavatam 1.1.1)[v1]God revealed this knowledge at the beginning of creation in the heart of the first-born Brahma, and the tradition continued from him. Shree Krishna stated in the last verse that he also revealed this knowledge to the Sun God, Vivasvan, from whom the tradition continued as well. However, the nature of this material world is such, that with the passage of time, this knowledge got lost. Materially-minded and insincere disciples interpret the teachings according to their blemished perspectives. Within a few generations, its pristine purity is contaminated. When this happens, by his causeless grace, God reestablishes the tradition for the benefit of humankind. He may do so, either by himself descending in the world, or through a great God-realized Saint, who becomes a conduit for God’s work on Earth.Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj, who is the fifth original Jagadguru in Indian history, is such a God-inspired Saint who has reestablished the ancient knowledge in modern times. When he was only thirty-four years old, the Kashi Vidvat Parishat, the supreme body of 500 Vedic scholars in the holy city of Kashi, honored him with the title of Jagadguru, or “Spiritual Master of the world.” He became the fifth Saint in Indian history to receive the original title of Jagadguru, after Jagadguru Shankaracharya, Jagadguru Nimbarkacharya, Jagadguru Ramanujacharya, and Jagadguru Madhvacharya. This commentary on the Bhagavad Gita has been written based upon its insightful understanding, as revealed to me by Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj.",in descending process receiving divine knowledge disciple understands science godrealization guru turn received guru it tradition saintly kings like nimi janak understood science yog this tradition starts god first guru worldtene brahma hṛidā ya ādikavaye muhyanti yat sūrayaḥ bhāgavatam god revealed knowledge beginning creation heart firstborn brahma tradition continued shree krishna stated last verse also revealed knowledge sun god vivasvan tradition continued well however nature material world passage time knowledge got lost materiallyminded insincere disciples interpret teachings according blemished perspectives within generations pristine purity contaminated when happens causeless grace god reestablishes tradition benefit humankind he may either descending world great godrealized saint becomes conduit god work earthjagadguru shree kripaluji maharaj fifth original jagadguru indian history godinspired saint reestablished ancient knowledge modern times when thirtyfour years old kashi vidvat parishat supreme body vedic scholars holy city kashi honored title jagadguru spiritual master world he became fifth saint indian history receive original title jagadguru jagadguru shankaracharya jagadguru nimbarkacharya jagadguru ramanujacharya jagadguru madhvacharya this commentary bhagavad gita written based upon insightful understanding revealed jagadguru shree kripaluji maharaj
4,3,स एवायं मया तेऽद्य योग: प्रोक्त: पुरातन: | भक्तोऽसि मे सखा चेति रहस्यं ह्येतदुत्तमम् ॥3॥,"That ancient Yoga itself, which is this, has been taught to you by Me today, considering that you are My devotee and friend, For, this (Yoga) is a profound secret.","Shree Krishna tells Arjun that the ancient science being imparted to him is an uncommonly known secret. Secrecy in the world is maintained for two reasons: either due to selfishness in keeping the truth to oneself, or to protect the abuse of knowledge. The science of Yog remains a secret, not for either of these reasons, but because it requires a qualification to be understood. That qualification is revealed in this verse as devotion. The deep message of the Bhagavad Gita is not amenable to being understood merely through scholasticism or mastery of the Sanskrit language. It requires devotion, which destroys the subtle envy of the soul toward God and enables us to accept the humble position as his tiny parts and servitors.Arjun was a fit student of this science because he was a devotee of the Lord. Devotion to God can be practiced in any of the five sequentially higher bhāvas, or sentiments: 1) Śhānt bhāv: adoring God as our King. 2) Dāsya bhav: the sentiment of servitude toward God as our Master. 3) Sakhya bhāv: considering God as our Friend. 4) Vātsalya bhāv: considering God as our Child. 5) Mādhurya bhāv: worshipping God as our Soul-beloved. Arjun worshipped God as his Friend, and so Shree Krishna speaks to him as his friend and devotee.Without a devotional heart, one cannot truly grasp the message of the Bhagavad Gita. This verse also invalidates the commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita written by scholars, jñānīs, yogis, tapasvīs, etc., who lack bhakti (devotion) toward God. According to this verse, since they are not devotees, they cannot comprehend the true import of the supreme science that was revealed to Arjun, and hence their commentaries are inaccurate and/or incomplete.",shree krishna tells arjun ancient science imparted uncommonly known secret secrecy world maintained two reasons either due selfishness keeping truth oneself protect abuse knowledge the science yog remains secret not either reasons requires qualification understood that qualification revealed verse devotion the deep message bhagavad gita not amenable understood merely scholasticism mastery sanskrit language it requires devotion destroys subtle envy soul toward god enables us accept humble position tiny parts servitorsarjun fit student science devotee lord devotion god practiced five sequentially higher bhāvas sentiments śhānt bhāv adoring god king dāsya bhav sentiment servitude toward god master sakhya bhāv considering god friend vātsalya bhāv considering god child mādhurya bhāv worshipping god soulbeloved arjun worshipped god friend shree krishna speaks friend devoteewithout devotional heart one not truly grasp message bhagavad gita this verse also invalidates commentaries bhagavad gita written scholars jñānīs yogis tapasvīs etc lack bhakti devotion toward god according verse since not devotees not comprehend true import supreme science revealed arjun hence commentaries inaccurate andor incomplete

The Sun god has been present since almost the beginning of creation, while Shree Krishna has only recently been born in the world. If Shree Krishna is the son of Vasudev and Devaki, then his statement that he taught this science to Vivasvan, the Sun god appears inconsistent to Arjun, and he inquires about it. Arjun’s question invites an exposition on the concept of the divine descension of God, and Shree Krishna responds to it in the subsequent verses.",arjun puzzled apparent incongruity events shree krishna statement the sun god present since almost beginning creation shree krishna recently born world if shree krishna son vasudev devaki statement taught science vivasvan sun god appears inconsistent arjun inquires arjun question invites exposition concept divine descension god shree krishna responds subsequent verses
4,5,श्रीभगवानुवाच | बहूनि मे व्यतीतानि जन्मानि तव चार्जुन | तान्यहं वेद सर्वाणि न त्वं वेत्थ परन्तप ॥5॥,"The Blessed Lord said: O Arjuna, many lives of Mine have passed, and so have yours. I know them all, (but) you know not, O scorcher of enemies!","Shree Krishna explains that merely because he is standing before Arjun in the human form, he should not be equated with human beings. The president of a country sometimes decides to visit the prison, but if we see the president standing in the jail, we do not erroneously conclude that he is also a convict. We know that he is in the jail merely for an inspection. Similarly, God sometimes descends in the material world, but he is never divested of his divine attributes and powers.In his commentary upon this verse, Shankaracharya states: yā vāsudeve anīśhvarāsarvajñāśhaṅkā mūrkhāṇāṁ tāṁ pariharan śhrī-bhagavān uvācha (Śhārīrak Bhāṣhya on verse 4.5)[v2] “This verse has been spoken by Shree Krishna to refute foolish people who doubt that he is not God.” Non-believers argue that Shree Krishna too was born like the rest of us, and he ate, drank, slept, like we all do, and so he could not have been God. Here, Shree Krishna emphasizes the difference between the soul and God by stating that although he descends in the world innumerable times, he still remains omniscient, unlike the soul whose knowledge is finite.The individual soul and the Supreme Soul, God, have many similarities—both are sat-chit-ānand (eternal, sentient, and blissful). However, there are also many differences. God is all-pervading, while the soul only pervades the body it inhabits; God is all-powerful, while the soul does not even have the power to liberate itself from Maya without God’s grace; God is the creator of the laws of nature, while the soul is subject to these laws; God is the upholder of the entire creation, while the soul is upheld by him; God is all-knowing, while the soul does not have complete knowledge even in one subject.Shree Krishna calls Arjun in this verse as “Parantapa,” meaning “subduer of the enemies.” He implies, “Arjun, you are a valiant warrior who has slayed so many powerful enemies. Now, do not accept defeat before this doubt that has crept into your mind. Use the sword of knowledge that I am giving you to slay it and be situated in wisdom.”",shree krishna explains merely standing arjun human form not equated human beings the president country sometimes decides visit prison see president standing jail not erroneously conclude also convict we know jail merely inspection similarly god sometimes descends material world never divested divine attributes powersin commentary upon verse shankaracharya states yā vāsudeve anīśhvarāsarvajñāśhaṅkā mūrkhāṇāṁ tāṁ pariharan śhrībhagavān uvācha śhārīrak bhāṣhya verse this verse spoken shree krishna refute foolish people doubt not god nonbelievers argue shree krishna born like rest us ate drank slept like could not god here shree krishna emphasizes difference soul god stating although descends world innumerable times still remains omniscient unlike soul whose knowledge finitethe individual soul supreme soul god many satchitānand eternal sentient blissful however also many differences god allpervading soul pervades body inhabits god allpowerful soul not even power liberate maya without god grace god creator laws nature soul subject laws god upholder entire creation soul upheld god allknowing soul not complete knowledge even one subjectshree krishna calls arjun verse parantapa meaning subduer enemies he implies arjun valiant warrior slayed many powerful enemies now not accept defeat doubt crept mind use sword knowledge i giving slay situated wisdom
4,6,अजोऽपि सन्नव्ययात्मा भूतानामीश्वरोऽपि सन् | प्रकृतिं स्वामधिष्ठाय सम्भवाम्यात्ममायया ॥6॥,"Though I am birthless, undecaying by nature, and the Lord of beings, (still) by subjugating My Prakriti, I take birth by means of My own Maya.","Many people revolt at the idea of a God who possesses a form. They are more comfortable with a formless God, who is all-pervading, incorporeal, and subtle. God is definitely incorporeal and formless, but that does not mean that he cannot simultaneously have a form as well. Since God is all-powerful, he has the power to manifest in a form if he wishes. If someone stipulates that God cannot have a form, it means that person does not accept him as all-powerful. Thus to say, “God is formless,” is an incomplete statement. On the other hand, to say, “God manifests in a personal form,” is also only a partial truth. The all-powerful God has both aspects to his divine personality—the personal form and the formless aspect. Hence, the Bṛihadāraṇyak Upaniṣhad states:dwe vāva brahmaṇo rūpe mūrtaṁ chaiva amūrtaṁ cha  (2.3.1)[v3]“God appears in both ways—as the formless Brahman and as the personal God.” They are both dimensions of his personality.In fact, the individual soul also has these two dimensions to its existence. It is formless, and hence, when it leaves the body upon death, it cannot be seen. Yet it takes on a body—not once, but innumerable times—as it transmigrates from birth to birth. When the tiny soul is able to possess a body, can the all-powerful God not have a form? Or is it that God says, “I do not have the power to manifest in a form, and hence I am only a formless light.” For him to be perfect and complete, he must be both personal and formless.The difference is that while our form is created from the material energy, Maya, God’s form is created by his divine energy, Yogmaya. It is thus divine, and beyond material defects. This has been nicely stated in the Padma Purāṇ:yastu nirguṇa ityuktaḥ śhāstreṣhu jagadīśhvaraḥprākṛitairheya sanyuktairguṇairhīnatvamuchyate  [v4]“Wherever the Vedic scriptures state that God does not have a form, they imply that his form is not subject to the blemishes of the material energy; rather, it is a divine form.”",many people revolt idea god possesses form they comfortable formless god allpervading incorporeal subtle god definitely incorporeal formless not mean not simultaneously form well since god allpowerful power manifest form wishes if someone stipulates god not form means person not accept allpowerful thus say god formless incomplete statement on hand say god manifests personal form also partial truth the allpowerful god aspects divine personal form formless aspect hence bṛihadāraṇyak upaniṣhad states dwe vāva brahmaṇo rūpe mūrtaṁ chaiva amūrtaṁ cha god appears formless brahman personal god they dimensions personalityin fact individual soul also two dimensions existence it formless hence leaves body upon death not seen yet takes innumerable transmigrates birth birth when tiny soul able possess body allpowerful god not form or god says i not power manifest form hence i formless light for perfect complete must personal formlessthe difference form created material energy maya god form created divine energy yogmaya it thus divine beyond material defects this nicely stated padma purāṇ yastu nirguṇa ityuktaḥ śhāstreṣhu jagadīśhvaraḥprākṛitairheya sanyuktairguṇairhīnatvamuchyate wherever vedic scriptures state god not form imply form not subject blemishes material energy rather divine form
4,7,यदा यदा हि धर्मस्य ग्लानिर्भवति भारत | अभ्युत्थानमधर्मस्य तदात्मानं सृजाम्यहम् ॥7॥,"O scion of the Bharata dynasty, whenever righteousness is on the decline, unrighteousness is in the ascendant, then I body Myself forth.","Dharma is verily the prescribed actions that are conducive to our spiritual growth and progress; the reverse of this is adharma (unrighteousness). When unrighteousness prevails, the creator and administrator of the world intervenes by descending and reestablishing dharma. Such a descension of God is called an Avatār. The word “Avatar” has been adopted from Sanskrit into English and is commonly used for people’s images on the media screen. In this text, we will be using it in its original Sanskrit connotation, to refer to the divine descension of God. Twenty four such descensions have been listed in the Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam. However, the Vedic scriptures state that there are innumerable descensions of God:janma-karmābhidhānāni santi me ’ṅga sahasraśhaḥna śhakyante ’nusaṅkhyātum anantatvān mayāpi hi(Bhāgavatam 10.51.37)[v5]“Nobody can count the infinite Avatars of God since the beginning of eternity.” These Avatars are classified in four categories, as stated below:1. Āveśhāvatār—when God manifests his special powers in an individual soul and acts through him. The sage Narad is an example of Āveśhāvatār. The Buddha is also an example of Āveśhāvatār.2. Prābhavāvatār—these are the descensions of God in the personal form, where he displays some of his divine powers. Prābhavāvatārs are also of two kinds:a) Where God reveals himself only for a few moments, completes his work, and then departs. Hansavatar is an example of this, where God manifested before the Kumaras, answered their question, and left.b) Where the Avatar remains on the earth for many years. Ved Vyas, who wrote the eighteen Puranas and the Mahabharat, and divided the Vedas into four parts, is an example of such an Avatar.3. Vaibhavatār—when God descends in his divine form, and manifests more of his divine powers. Matsyavatar, Kurmavatar, Varahavatar are all examples of Vaibhavatārs.4. Parāvasthāvatār—when God manifests all his divine powers in his personal divine form. Shree Krishna, Shree Ram, and Nrisinghavatar are all Parāvasthāvatār.This classification does not imply that any one Avatār is bigger than the other. Ved Vyas, who is himself an Avatār, clearly states this: sarve pūrṇāḥ śhāśhvatāśhcha dehāstasya paramātmanaḥ (Padma Purāṇ)[v6] “All the descensions of God are replete with all divine powers; they are all perfect and complete.” Hence, we should not differentiate one Avatar as bigger and another as smaller. However, in each descension, God manifests his powers based on the objectives he wishes to accomplish during that particular descension. The remaining powers reside latently within the Avatar. Hence, the above classifications were created.",dharma verily prescribed actions conducive spiritual growth progress reverse adharma unrighteousness when unrighteousness prevails creator administrator world intervenes descending reestablishing dharma such descension god called avatār the word avatar adopted sanskrit english commonly used people images media screen in text using original sanskrit connotation refer divine descension god twenty four descensions listed śhrīmad bhāgavatam however vedic scriptures state innumerable descensions god janmakarmābhidhānāni santi ṅga sahasraśhaḥna śhakyante nusaṅkhyātum anantatvān mayāpi hi bhāgavatam nobody count infinite avatars god since beginning eternity these avatars classified four categories stated god manifests special powers individual soul acts the sage narad example āveśhāvatār the buddha also example descensions god personal form displays divine powers prābhavāvatārs also two kinds where god reveals moments completes work departs hansavatar example god manifested kumaras answered question leftb where avatar remains earth many years ved vyas wrote eighteen puranas mahabharat divided vedas four parts example god descends divine form manifests divine powers matsyavatar kurmavatar varahavatar examples god manifests divine powers personal divine form shree krishna shree ram nrisinghavatar parāvasthāvatārthis classification not imply one avatār bigger ved vyas avatār clearly states sarve pūrṇāḥ śhāśhvatāśhcha dehāstasya paramātmanaḥ padma purāṇ all descensions god replete divine powers perfect complete hence not differentiate one avatar bigger another smaller however descension god manifests powers based objectives wishes accomplish particular descension the remaining powers reside latently within avatar hence classifications created
4,8,परित्राणाय साधूनां विनाशाय च दुष्कृताम् | धर्मसंस्थापनार्थाय सम्भवामि युगे युगे ॥8॥,"For the protection of the pious, the destruction of the evil-doers, and establishing virtue, I manifest Myself in every age.","Having stated in the last verse that God descends in the world, he now states the three reasons for doing so: 1) To annihilate the wicked. 2) To protect the pious. 3) To establish dharma. However, if we closely study these three points, none of the three reasons seem very convincing:To protect the righteous. God is seated in the hearts of his devotees, and always protects them from within. There is no need to take an Avatar for this purpose.To annihilate the wicked. God is all-powerful, and can kill the wicked merely by wishing it. Why should he have to take an Avatar to accomplish this?To establish dharma.  Dharma is eternally described in the Vedas. God can reestablish it through a Saint; he does not need to descend himself, in his personal form, to accomplish this.How then do we make sense of the reasons that have been stated in this verse? Let’s delve a little deeper to grasp the import of what Shree Krishna is stating.The biggest dharma that the soul can engage in is devotion to God. That is what God strengthens by taking an Avatār. When God descends in the world, he reveals his divine forms, names, virtues, pastimes, abodes, and associates. This provides the souls with an easy basis for devotion. Since the mind needs a form to focus upon and to connect with, the formless aspect of God is very difficult to worship. On the other hand, devotion to the personal form of God is easy for people to comprehend, simple to perform, and sweet to engage in.Thus, since the descension of Lord Krishna 5,000 years ago, billions of souls have made his divine leelas (pastimes) as the basis of their devotion, and purified their minds with ease and joy. Similarly, the Ramayan has provided the souls with a popular basis for devotion for innumerable centuries. When the TV show, Ramayan, first began airing on Indian national television on Sunday mornings, all the streets of India would become empty. The pastimes of Lord Ram held such fascination for the people that they would be glued to their television sets to see the leelas on the screen. This reveals how Lord Ram’s descension provided the basis for devotion to billions of souls in history. The Ramayan says:rām eka tāpasa tiya tārī, nāma koṭi khala kumati sudhārī [v7]“In his descension period, Lord Ram helped only one Ahalya (Sage Gautam’s wife, whom Lord Ram released from the body of stone). However, since then, by chanting the divine name “Ram,” billions of fallen souls have elevated themselves.” So a deeper understanding of this verse is:To establish dharma: God descends to establish the dharma of devotion by providing souls with his names, forms, pastimes, virtues, abodes, and associates, with the help of which they may engage in bhakti and purify their minds.To kill the wicked: Along with God, to help facilitate his divine pastimes, some liberated Saints descend and pretend to be miscreants. For example, Ravan and Kumbhakarna were Jaya and Vijaya who descended from the divine abode of God. They pretended to be demons and opposed and fought with Ram. They could not have been killed by anyone else, since they were divine personalities. So, God slayed such demons as a part of his leelas. And having killed them, he sent them to his divine abode, since that was where they came from in the first place.To protect the righteous: Many souls had become sufficiently elevated in their sādhanā (spiritual practice) to qualify to meet God face-to-face. When Shree Krishna descended in the world, these eligible souls got their first opportunity to participate in God’s divine pastimes. For example, some gopīs (cowherd women of Vrindavan, where Shree Krishna manifested his pastimes) were liberated souls who had descended from the divine abode to assist in Shree Krishna’s leelas. Other gopīs were materially bound souls who got their first chance to meet and serve God, and participate in his leelas. So when Shree Krishna descended in the world, such qualified souls got the opportunity to perfect their devotion by directly participating in the pastimes of God.This is the deeper meaning of the verse. However, it is not wrong if someone wishes to cognize the verse more literally or metaphorically.",having stated last verse god descends world states three reasons to annihilate wicked to protect pious to establish dharma however closely study three points none three reasons seem convincing to protect righteous god seated hearts devotees always protects within there need take avatar purposeto annihilate wicked god allpowerful kill wicked merely wishing why take avatar accomplish to establish dharma dharma eternally described vedas god reestablish saint not need descend personal form accomplish thishow make sense reasons stated verse let delve little deeper grasp import shree krishna statingthe biggest dharma soul engage devotion god that god strengthens taking avatār when god descends world reveals divine forms names virtues pastimes abodes associates this provides souls easy basis devotion since mind needs form focus upon connect formless aspect god difficult worship on hand devotion personal form god easy people comprehend simple perform sweet engage inthus since descension lord krishna years ago billions souls made divine leelas pastimes basis devotion purified minds ease joy similarly ramayan provided souls popular basis devotion innumerable centuries when tv show ramayan first began airing indian national television sunday mornings streets india would become empty the pastimes lord ram held fascination people would glued television sets see leelas screen this reveals lord ram descension provided basis devotion billions souls history the ramayan says rām eka tāpasa tiya tārī nāma koṭi khala kumati sudhārī in descension period lord ram helped one ahalya sage gautam wife lord ram released body stone however since chanting divine name ram billions fallen souls elevated themselves so deeper understanding verse to establish dharma god descends establish dharma devotion providing souls names forms pastimes virtues abodes associates help may engage bhakti purify mindsto kill wicked along god help facilitate divine pastimes liberated saints descend pretend miscreants for example ravan kumbhakarna jaya vijaya descended divine abode god they pretended demons opposed fought ram they could not killed anyone else since divine personalities so god slayed demons part leelas and killed sent divine abode since came first placeto protect righteous many souls become sufficiently elevated sādhanā spiritual practice qualify meet god facetoface when shree krishna descended world eligible souls got first opportunity participate god divine pastimes for example gopīs cowherd women vrindavan shree krishna manifested pastimes liberated souls descended divine abode assist shree krishna leelas other gopīs materially bound souls got first chance meet serve god participate leelas so shree krishna descended world qualified souls got opportunity perfect devotion directly participating pastimes godthis deeper meaning verse however not wrong someone wishes cognize verse literally metaphorically
4,9,जन्म कर्म च मे दिव्यमेवं यो वेत्ति तत्त्वत: | त्यक्त्वा देहं पुनर्जन्म नैति मामेति सोऽर्जुन ॥9॥,"He who thus knows truly the divine birth and actions of Mine does not get re-birth after casting off the body. He attains Me, O Arjuna.","Understand this verse in the light of the previous one. Our mind gets cleansed by engaging it in devotional remembrance of God. This devotion can either be toward the formless aspect of God or toward his personal form. Devotion toward the formless is intangible and nebulous to most people. They find nothing to focus upon or feel connected with during such devotional meditation. Devotion to the personal form of God is tangible and simple. Such devotion requires divine sentiments toward the personality of God. For people to engage in devotion to Shree Krishna, they must develop divine feelings toward his names, form, virtues, pastimes, abode, and associates. For example, people purify their minds by worshipping stone deities because they harbor the divine sentiments that God resides in these deities. It is these sentiments that purify the devotee’s mind. The progenitor Manu says:na kāṣhṭhe vidyate devo na śhilāyāṁ na mṛitsu chabhāve hi vidyate devastasmātbhāvaṁ samācharet [v8]“God resides neither in wood nor in stone, but in a devotional heart. Hence, worship the deity with loving sentiments.”Similarly, if we wish to engage in devotion toward Lord Krishna, we must learn to harbor divine sentiments toward his leelas. Those commentators who give a figurative interpretation to the Mahabharat and the Bhagavad Gita, do grave injustice by destroying the basis of people’s faith in devotion toward Shree Krishna. In this verse, Shree Krishna has emphasized the need for divine sentiments toward his pastimes, for enhancing our devotion.To develop such divine feelings, we must understand the difference between God’s actions and ours. We materially bound souls have not yet attained divine bliss, and hence the longing of our soul is not yet satiated. Thus, our actions are motivated by self-interest and the desire for personal fulfillment. However, God’s actions have no personal motive because he is perfectly satiated by the infinite bliss of his own personality. He does not need to achieve further personal bliss by performing actions. Therefore, whatever he does is for the welfare of the materially conditioned souls. Such divine actions that God performs are termed as “leelas” while the actions we perform are called “work.”Similarly, God’s birth is also divine, and unlike ours, it does not take place from a mother’s womb. The all-Blissful God has no requirement to hang upside down in a mother’s womb. The Bhāgavatam states:tam adbhutaṁ bālakam ambujekṣhaṇaṁchatur-bhujaṁ śhaṅkha gadādyudāyudham(10.3.9) [v9]“When Shree Krishna manifested upon birth before Vasudev and Devaki, he was in his four-armed Vishnu form.” This full-sized form could definitely not have resided in Devaki’s womb. However, to create in her the feeling that he was there, by his Yogmaya power, he simply kept expanding Devaki’s womb. Finally, he manifested from the outside, revealing that he had never been inside her:āvirāsīd yathā prāchyāṁ diśhīndur iva puṣhkalaḥ(Bhāgavatam 10.3.8) [v10]“As the moon manifests in its full glory in the night sky, similarly the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna manifested before Devaki and Vasudev.” This is the divine nature of God’s birth. If we can develop faith in the divinity of his pastimes and birth, then we will be able to easily engage in devotion to his personal form, and attain the supreme destination.",understand verse light previous one our mind gets cleansed engaging devotional remembrance god this devotion either toward formless aspect god toward personal form devotion toward formless intangible nebulous people they find nothing focus upon feel connected devotional meditation devotion personal form god tangible simple such devotion requires divine sentiments toward personality god for people engage devotion shree krishna must develop divine feelings toward names form virtues pastimes abode associates for example people purify minds worshipping stone deities harbor divine sentiments god resides deities it sentiments purify devotee mind the progenitor manu says na kāṣhṭhe vidyate devo na śhilāyāṁ na mṛitsu chabhāve hi vidyate devastasmātbhāvaṁ samācharet god resides neither wood stone devotional heart hence worship deity loving sentiments similarly wish engage devotion toward lord krishna must learn harbor divine sentiments toward leelas those commentators give figurative interpretation mahabharat bhagavad gita grave injustice destroying basis people faith devotion toward shree krishna in verse shree krishna emphasized need divine sentiments toward pastimes enhancing devotionto develop divine feelings must understand difference god actions we materially bound souls not yet attained divine bliss hence longing soul not yet satiated thus actions motivated selfinterest desire personal fulfillment however god actions personal motive perfectly satiated infinite bliss personality he not need achieve personal bliss performing actions therefore whatever welfare materially conditioned souls such divine actions god performs termed leelas actions perform called work similarly god birth also divine unlike not take place mother womb the allblissful god requirement hang upside mother womb the bhāgavatam states tam adbhutaṁ bālakam ambujekṣhaṇaṁchaturbhujaṁ śhaṅkha gadādyudāyudham when shree krishna manifested upon birth vasudev devaki fourarmed vishnu form this fullsized form could definitely not resided devaki womb however create feeling yogmaya power simply kept expanding devaki womb finally manifested outside revealing never inside āvirāsīd yathā prāchyāṁ diśhīndur iva puṣhkalaḥ bhāgavatam as moon manifests full glory night sky similarly supreme lord shree krishna manifested devaki vasudev this divine nature god birth if develop faith divinity pastimes birth able easily engage devotion personal form attain supreme destination
4,10,वीतरागभयक्रोधा मन्मया मामुपाश्रिता: | बहवो ज्ञानतपसा पूता मद्भावमागता: ॥10॥,"Many who were devoid of attachment, fear and anger, who were absorbed in Me, who had taken refuge in Me, and were purified by the austerity of Knowledge, have attained My state.","In the previous verse, Lord Krishna explained that those who truly know the divine nature of his birth and pastimes attain him. He now confirms that legions of human beings in all ages became God-realized by this means. They achieved this goal by purifying their minds through devotion. Shree Aurobindo put it very nicely: “You must keep the temple of the heart clean, if you wish to install therein the living presence.” The Bible states: “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.” (Matthew 5.8) [v11]Now, how does the mind get purified? By giving up attachment, fear, and anger, and absorbing the mind in God. Actually, attachment is the cause of both fear and anger. Fear arises out of apprehension that the object of our attachment will be snatched away from us. And anger arises when there is an obstruction in attaining the object of our attachment. Attachment is thus the root cause of the mind getting dirty.This world of Maya consists of the three modes of material nature—sattva, rajas, and tamas (goodness, passion, and ignorance). All objects and personalities in the world come within the realm of these three modes. When we attach our mind to a material object or person, our mind too becomes affected by the three modes. Instead, when we absorb the same mind in God, who is beyond the three modes of material nature, such devotion purifies the mind. Thus, the sovereign recipe to cleanse the mind from the defects of lust, anger, greed, envy, and illusion, is to detach it from the world and attach it to the Supreme Lord. Hence, the Ramayan states:prema bhagati jala binu raghurāī, abhiantara mala kabahuñ na jāī“Without devotion to God, the dirt of the mind will not be washed away.” Even the ardent propagator of jñāna yog, Shankaracharya, stated:śhuddhayati hi nāntarātmā kṛiṣhṇapadāmbhoja bhaktimṛite (Prabodh Sudhākar)[v13]“Without engaging in devotion to the lotus feet of Lord Krishna, the mind will not be cleansed.”On reading the previous verse, a question may arise whether Lord Krishna is partial in bestowing his grace upon those who absorb their minds in him versus the worldly-minded souls. The Supreme Lord addresses this in the next verse.",in previous verse lord krishna explained truly know divine nature birth pastimes attain he confirms legions human beings ages became godrealized means they achieved goal purifying minds devotion shree aurobindo put nicely you must keep temple heart clean wish install therein living presence the bible states blessed pure heart shall see god matthew now mind get purified by giving attachment fear anger absorbing mind god actually attachment cause fear anger fear arises apprehension object attachment snatched away us and anger arises obstruction attaining object attachment attachment thus root cause mind getting dirtythis world maya consists three modes material rajas tamas goodness passion ignorance all objects personalities world come within realm three modes when attach mind material object person mind becomes affected three modes instead absorb mind god beyond three modes material nature devotion purifies mind thus sovereign recipe cleanse mind defects lust anger greed envy illusion detach world attach supreme lord hence ramayan states prema bhagati jala binu raghurāī abhiantara mala kabahuñ na jāī without devotion god dirt mind not washed away even ardent propagator jñāna yog shankaracharya stated śhuddhayati hi nāntarātmā kṛiṣhṇapadāmbhoja bhaktimṛite prabodh sudhākar without engaging devotion lotus feet lord krishna mind not cleansed on reading previous verse question may arise whether lord krishna partial bestowing grace upon absorb minds versus worldlyminded souls the supreme lord addresses next verse
4,11,ये यथा मां प्रपद्यन्ते तांस्तथैव भजाम्यहम् | मम वर्त्मानुवर्तन्ते मनुष्या: पार्थ सर्वश: ॥11॥,"According to the manner in which they approach Me, I favour them in that very manner. O son of Partha, human beings follow My path in every way.","Here, Lord Krishna states that he reciprocates with everyone as they surrender to him. For those who deny the existence of God, he meets them in the form of the law of karma—he sits inside their hearts, notes their actions, and dispenses the results. But such atheists too cannot get away from serving him; they are obliged to serve God’s material energy, Maya, in its various apparitions, as wealth, luxuries, relatives, prestige, etc. Maya holds them under the sway of anger, lust, and greed. On the other hand, for those who turn their mind away from worldly attractions and look upon God as the goal and refuge, he takes care of them just as a mother takes care of her child.Shree Krishna uses the word bhajāmi, which means “to serve.” He serves the surrendered souls, by destroying their accumulated karmas of endless lifetimes, cutting the bonds of Maya, removing the darkness of material existence, and bestowing divine bliss, divine knowledge, and divine love. And when the devotee learns to love God selflessly, he willingly enslaves himself to their love. Shree Ram thus tells Hanuman:ekaikasyopakārasya prāṇān dāsyāmi te kapeśheṣhasyehopakārāṇāṁ bhavām ṛiṇino vayaṁ(Vālmīki Ramayan)[v14]“O Hanuman, to release myself from the debt of one service you performed for me, I shall have to offer my life to you. For all the other devotional services done by you, I shall remain eternally indebted.” In this way, God reciprocates with everyone as they surrender to him.If God is so merciful upon his devotees, why do some people worship the celestial gods instead? He explains in the following verse.",here lord krishna states reciprocates everyone surrender for deny existence god meets form law sits inside hearts notes actions dispenses results but atheists not get away serving obliged serve god material energy maya various apparitions wealth luxuries relatives prestige etc maya holds sway anger lust greed on hand turn mind away worldly attractions look upon god goal refuge takes care mother takes care childshree krishna uses word bhajāmi means serve he serves surrendered souls destroying accumulated karmas endless lifetimes cutting bonds maya removing darkness material existence bestowing divine bliss divine knowledge divine love and devotee learns love god selflessly willingly enslaves love shree ram thus tells hanuman ekaikasyopakārasya prāṇān dāsyāmi te kapeśheṣhasyehopakārāṇāṁ bhavām ṛiṇino vayaṁ vālmīki ramayan o hanuman release debt one service performed i shall offer life for devotional services done i shall remain eternally indebted in way god reciprocates everyone surrender himif god merciful upon devotees people worship celestial gods instead he explains following verse
4,12,काङ् क्षन्त: कर्मणां सिद्धिं यजन्त इह देवता: | क्षिप्रं हि मानुषे लोके सिद्धिर्भवति कर्मजा ॥12॥,"Longing for the fruition of actions (of their rites and duties), they worship the gods here. For, in the human world, success from action comes quickly.","Persons who seek worldly gain worship the celestial gods and seek boons from them. The boons the celestial gods bestow are material and temporary, and they are given only by virtue of the power they have received from the Supreme Lord. There is a beautiful instructive story in this regard:Saint Farid went to the court of Emperor Akbar, a powerful king in Indian history. He waited in the court for an audience, while Akbar was praying in the next room. Farid peeped into the room to see what was going on, and was amused to hear Akbar praying to God for more powerful army, a bigger treasure chest, and success in battle. Without disturbing the king, Farid returned to the royal court.After completing his prayers, Akbar came and gave him audience. He asked the great Sage if there was anything that he wanted. Farid replied, “I came to ask the Emperor for things I required for my āśhram. However, I find that the Emperor is himself a beggar before the Lord. Then why should I ask him for any favors, and not directly from the Lord himself?”The celestial gods give boons only by the powers bestowed upon them by the Supreme Lord. People with small understanding approach them, but those who are intelligent realize that there is no point in going to the intermediary and they approach the Supreme Lord for the fulfillment of their aspirations. People are of various kinds, possessing higher and lower aspirations. Shree Krishna now mentions four categories of qualities and works.",persons seek worldly gain worship celestial gods seek boons the boons celestial gods bestow material temporary given virtue power received supreme lord there beautiful instructive story regard saint farid went court emperor akbar powerful king indian history he waited court audience akbar praying next room farid peeped room see going amused hear akbar praying god powerful army bigger treasure chest success battle without disturbing king farid returned royal courtafter completing prayers akbar came gave audience he asked great sage anything wanted farid replied i came ask emperor things i required āśhram however i find emperor beggar lord then i ask favors not directly lord the celestial gods give boons powers bestowed upon supreme lord people small understanding approach intelligent realize point going intermediary approach supreme lord fulfillment aspirations people various kinds possessing higher lower aspirations shree krishna mentions four categories qualities works
4,13,चातुर्वर्ण्यं मया सृष्टं गुणकर्मविभागश: | तस्य कर्तारमपि मां विद्ध्यकर्तारमव्ययम् ॥13॥,"The four castes have been created by Me through a classification of the gunas and duties. Even though I am the agent of that (act of classification), still know Me to be a non-agent and changeless.","The Vedas classify people into four categories of occupations, not according to their birth, but according to their natures. Such varieties of occupations exist in every society. Even in communist nations where equality is the overriding principle, the diversity in human beings cannot be smothered. There are the philosophers who are the communist party think-tanks, there are the military men who protect the country, there are the farmers who engage in agriculture, and there are the factory workers.The Vedic philosophy explains this variety in a more scientific manner. It states that the material energy is constituted of three guṇas (modes): sattva guṇa (mode of goodness), rajo guṇa (mode of passion), and tamo guṇa (mode of ignorance). The Brahmins are those who have a preponderance of the mode of goodness. They are predisposed toward teaching and worship. The Kshatriyas are those who have a preponderance of the mode of passion mixed with a smaller amount of the mode of goodness. They are inclined toward administration and management. The Vaishyas are those who possess the mode of passion mixed with some mode of ignorance. Accordingly, they form the business and agricultural class. Then there are the Shudras, who are predominated by the mode of ignorance. They form the working class. This classification was neither meant to be according to birth, nor was it unchangeable. Shree Krishna explains in this verse that the classification of the Varṇāśhram system was according to people’s qualities and activities.Although God is the creator of the scheme of the world, yet he is the non-doer. This is similar to the rain. Just as rain water falls equally on the forest, yet from some seeds huge banyan trees sprout, from other seeds beautiful flowers bloom, and from some thorny bushes emerge. The rain, which is impartial, is not answerable for this difference. In the same way, God provides the souls with the energy to act, but they are free in determining what they wish to do with it; God is not responsible for their actions.",the vedas classify people four categories occupations not according birth according natures such varieties occupations exist every society even communist nations equality overriding principle diversity human beings not smothered there philosophers communist party thinktanks military men protect country farmers engage agriculture factory workersthe vedic philosophy explains variety scientific manner it states material energy constituted three guṇas modes sattva guṇa mode goodness rajo guṇa mode passion tamo guṇa mode ignorance the brahmins preponderance mode goodness they predisposed toward teaching worship the kshatriyas preponderance mode passion mixed smaller amount mode goodness they inclined toward administration management the vaishyas possess mode passion mixed mode ignorance accordingly form business agricultural class then shudras predominated mode ignorance they form working class this classification neither meant according birth unchangeable shree krishna explains verse classification varṇāśhram system according people qualities activitiesalthough god creator scheme world yet nondoer this similar rain just rain water falls equally forest yet seeds huge banyan trees sprout seeds beautiful flowers bloom thorny bushes emerge the rain impartial not answerable difference in way god provides souls energy act free determining wish god not responsible actions
4,14,न मां कर्माणि लिम्पन्ति न मे कर्मफले स्पृहा | इति मां योऽभिजानाति कर्मभिर्न स बध्यते ॥14॥,"Actions do not taint Me; for Me there is no hankering for the results of actions. One who knows Me thus, does not become bound by actions.","God is all-pure, and whatever he does also becomes pure and auspicious. The Ramayan states:samaratha kahuñ nahiṅ doṣhu gosāīṅ, rabi pāvaka surasari kī nāīṅ. [v15]“Pure personalities are never tainted by defects even in contact with impure situations and entities, like the sun, the fire, and the Ganges.” The sun does not get tainted if sunlight falls on a puddle of urine. The sun retains its purity, while also purifying the dirty puddle. Similarly, if we offer impure objects into the fire, it still retains its purity—the fire is pure, and whatever we pour into it also gets purified. In the same manner, numerous gutters of rainwater merge into the holy Ganges, but this does not make the Ganges a gutter—the Ganges is pure and in transforms all those dirty gutters into the holy Ganges. Likewise, God is not tainted by the activities he performs.Activities bind one in karmic reactions when they are performed with the mentality of enjoying the results. However, God’s actions are not motivated by selfishness; his every act is driven by compassion for the souls. Therefore, although he administers the world directly or indirectly, and engages in all kinds of activities in the process, he is never tainted by any reactions. Lord Krishna states here that he is transcendental to the fruitive reactions of work.Even Saints who are situated in God-consciousness become transcendental to the material energy. Since all their activities are effectuated in love for God, such pure-hearted Saints are not bound by the fruitive reactions of work. The Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam states:yat pāda paṅkaja parāga niṣheva tṛiptāyoga prabhāva vidhutākhila karma bandhāḥsvairaṁ charanti munayo ’pi na nahyamānāstasyechchhayātta vapuṣhaḥ kuta eva bandhaḥ(10.33.35) [v16]“Material activities never taint the devotees of God who are fully satisfied in serving the dust of his lotus feet. Nor do material activities taint those wise sages who have freed themselves from the bondage of fruitive reactions by the power of Yog. So where is the question of bondage for the Lord himself who assumes his transcendental form according to his own sweet will?”",god allpure whatever also becomes pure auspicious the ramayan states samaratha kahuñ nahiṅ doṣhu gosāīṅ rabi pāvaka surasari kī nāīṅ pure personalities never tainted defects even contact impure situations entities like sun fire ganges the sun not get tainted sunlight falls puddle urine the sun retains purity also purifying dirty puddle similarly offer impure objects fire still retains fire pure whatever pour also gets purified in manner numerous gutters rainwater merge holy ganges not make ganges ganges pure transforms dirty gutters holy ganges likewise god not tainted activities performsactivities bind one karmic reactions performed mentality enjoying results however god actions not motivated selfishness every act driven compassion souls therefore although administers world directly indirectly engages kinds activities process never tainted reactions lord krishna states transcendental fruitive reactions workeven saints situated godconsciousness become transcendental material energy since activities effectuated love god purehearted saints not bound fruitive reactions work the śhrīmad bhāgavatam states yat pāda paṅkaja parāga niṣheva tṛiptāyoga prabhāva vidhutākhila karma bandhāḥsvairaṁ charanti munayo pi na nahyamānāstasyechchhayātta vapuṣhaḥ kuta eva bandhaḥ material activities never taint devotees god fully satisfied serving dust lotus feet nor material activities taint wise sages freed bondage fruitive reactions power yog so question bondage lord assumes transcendental form according sweet

Therefore, you undertake action itself as was performed earlier by the ancient ones.","The sages who aspire for God are not motivated to work for material gain. Why then do they engage in activities in this world? The reason is that they wish to serve God, and are inspired to do works for his pleasure. The knowledge of the previous verse assures them that they themselves will never be bound by welfare work that is done in the spirit of devotion. They are also moved by compassion on seeing the sufferings of the materially bound souls who are bereft of God consciousness, and are inspired to work for their spiritual elevation. The Buddha once said, “After attaining enlightenment, you have two options—either you do nothing, or you help others attain enlightenment.”Thus, even sages who have no selfish motive for work still engage in activities for the pleasure of God. Working in devotion also attracts the grace of God. Shree Krishna is advising Arjun to do the same.  Having asked Arjun to perform actions that do not bind one, the Lord now begins expounding the philosophy of action.",the sages aspire god not motivated work material gain why engage activities world the reason wish serve god inspired works pleasure the knowledge previous verse assures never bound welfare work done spirit devotion they also moved compassion seeing sufferings materially bound souls bereft god consciousness inspired work spiritual elevation the buddha said after attaining enlightenment two nothing help others attain enlightenment thus even sages selfish motive work still engage activities pleasure god working devotion also attracts grace god shree krishna advising arjun having asked arjun perform actions not bind one lord begins expounding philosophy action

Even intelligent persons become confused in the maze of apparently contradictory arguments presented by the scriptures and the sages. For example, the Vedas recommend non-violence. Accordingly in the Mahabharat, Arjun wishes to follow the same course of action and shun violence but Shree Krishna says that his duty here is to engage in violence. If duty varies with circumstance, then to ascertain one’s duty in any particular situation is a complex matter. Yamraj, the celestial god of Death, stated:dharmaṁ tu sākṣhād bhagavat praṇītaṁ na vai vidur ṛiṣhayo nāpi devāḥ(Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam 6.3.19)[v17]“What is proper action and what is improper action? This is difficult to determine even for the great ṛiṣhis and the celestial gods.

They give up actions physically, but their mind continues to contemplate upon the objects of the senses.

When Arjun suggested that he wishes to shy away from his duty of fighting the war, Shree Krishna explained to him that it would be a sin, and he would go to the hellish regions for such inaction.Inaction in action. There is another kind of inaction performed by karm yogis. They execute their social duties without attachment to results, dedicating the fruits of their actions to God. Although engaged in all kinds of activities, they are not entangled in karmic reactions, since they have no motive for personal enjoyment. There were many great kings in Indian history—Dhruv, Prahlad, Yudhisthir, Prithu, and Ambarish—who discharged their kingly duties to the best of their abilities, and yet because their minds were not entangled in material desires, their actions were termed Akarm, or inaction.

It then strives to perform every action for the pleasure of God. “Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer as oblation to the sacred fire, whatever you bestow as a gift, and whatever austerities you perform, O son of Kunti, do them as an offering to me.” (Bhagavad Gita 9.27) Since such an enlightened soul renounces selfish actions for material pleasures and dedicates all actions to God, the works performed produce no karmic reactions.

It is the state of the mind that determines what is inaction and action. The minds of enlightened persons are absorbed in God. Being fully satisfied in devotional union with him, they look upon God as their only refuge and do not depend upon external supports. In this state of mind, all their actions are termed as akarm, or inactions.There is a beautiful story in the Puranas to illustrate this point. The gopīs (cowherd women) of Vrindavan once kept a fast. The ceremony of breaking the fast required them to feed a sage. Shree Krishna advised them to feed Sage Durvasa, the elevated ascetic, who lived on the other side of River Yamuna. The gopīs prepared a delicious feast and started off, but found the river was very turbulent that day, and no boatman was willing to ferry them across.The gopīs asked Shree Krishna for a solution. He said, “Tell River Yamuna that if Shree Krishna is an akhaṇḍ brahmacharī (perfectly celibate since birth), it should give them way.” The gopīs started laughing, because they felt that Shree Krishna used to dote upon them, and so there was no question of his being an akhaṇḍ brahmacharī. Nevertheless, when they requested River Yamuna in that manner, the river gave them way and a bridge of flowers manifested for their passage across.The gopīs were astonished. They went across to the āśhram of Sage Durvasa. They requested him to accept the delicious meal they had brought for him. Being an ascetic, he ate only a small portion, which disappointed the gopīs. So, Durvasa decided to fulfill their expectations, and using his mystic powers, he ate everything they had brought. The gopīs were amazed to see him eat so much, but were very pleased that he had done justice to their cooking.The gopīs now asked Durvasa for help to cross the Yamuna and return to the other side. He replied, “Tell River Yamuna that if Durvasa has not eaten anything today except doob (a kind of grass which was the only thing Durvasa used to eat), the river should give way.” The gopīs again started laughing, for they had seen him eat such an extravagant meal. Yet to their utmost surprise, when they beseeched River Yamuna in that manner, the river again gave them way.The gopīs asked Shree Krishna the secret behind what had happened. He explained that while God and the Saints appear to engage in material activities externally, internally they are always transcendentally situated. Thus, even while doing all kinds of actions, they are still considered to be non-doers. Although interacting with the gopīs externally, Shree Krishna was an akhaṇḍ brahmacharī internally. And though Durvasa ate the delectable meal offered by the gopīs, internally his mind only tasted the doob grass. Both these were illustrations of inaction in action.",actions not classified external appearances it state mind determines inaction action the minds enlightened persons absorbed god being fully satisfied devotional union look upon god refuge not depend upon external supports in state mind actions termed akarm inactionsthere beautiful story puranas illustrate point the gopīs cowherd women vrindavan kept fast the ceremony breaking fast required feed sage shree krishna advised feed sage durvasa elevated ascetic lived side river yamuna the gopīs prepared delicious feast started found river turbulent day boatman willing ferry acrossthe gopīs asked shree krishna solution he said tell river yamuna shree krishna akhaṇḍ brahmacharī perfectly celibate since birth give way the gopīs started laughing felt shree krishna used dote upon question akhaṇḍ brahmacharī nevertheless requested river yamuna manner river gave way bridge flowers manifested passage acrossthe gopīs astonished they went across āśhram sage durvasa they requested accept delicious meal brought being ascetic ate small portion disappointed gopīs so durvasa decided fulfill expectations using mystic powers ate everything brought the gopīs amazed see eat much pleased done justice cookingthe gopīs asked durvasa help cross yamuna return side he replied tell river yamuna durvasa not eaten anything today except doob kind grass thing durvasa used eat river give way the gopīs started laughing seen eat extravagant meal yet utmost surprise beseeched river yamuna manner river gave waythe gopīs asked shree krishna secret behind happened he explained god saints appear engage material activities externally internally always transcendentally situated thus even kinds actions still considered nondoers although interacting gopīs externally shree krishna akhaṇḍ brahmacharī internally and though durvasa ate delectable meal offered gopīs internally mind tasted doob grass both illustrations inaction action

Lord Ram himself, in his divine pastimes, was exiled to the forest the day before he was to be crowned as the king of Ayodhya.While living in this world, nobody can hope to neutralize the dualities to have only positive experiences. Then how can we successfully deal with the dualities that come our way in life? The solution is to take these dualities in stride, by learning to rise above them in equipoise in all situations.

Brahman alone is to be reached by him who has concentration on Brahman as the objective [As an object to be known and attained. (Some translate brahma-karma-samadhina as, 'by him who sees Brahman in action'.)","Factually, the objects of the world are made from Maya, the material energy of God. Energy is both one with its energetic and also different from it. For example, light is the energy of fire. It can be considered as different from the fire, because it exists outside it. But it can also be reckoned as a part of the fire itself. Hence, when the rays of the sun enter the room through a window, people say, “The sun has come.” Here, they are bundling the sunrays with the sun. The energy is both distinct from the energetic and yet a part of it.The soul too is the energy of God—it is a spiritual energy, called jīva śhakti. Shree Krishna states this in verse 7.5.Chaitanya Mahaprabhu stated:jīva-tattva śhakti, kṛiṣhṇa-tattva śhaktimāngītā-viṣhṇupurāṇādi tāhāte pramāṇa(Chaitanya Charitāmṛit, Ādi Leela, 7.117)[v19]“Lord Krishna is the energetic and the soul is his energy. This has been stated in Bhagavad Gita, Viṣhṇu Purāṇ, etc.” Thus, the soul is also simultaneously one with and different from God. Hence, those whose minds are fully absorbed in God-consciousness see the whole world in its unity with God as non-different from him. The Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam states:sarva-bhūteṣhu yaḥ paśhyed bhagavad-bhāvam ātmanaḥbhūtāni bhagavatyātmanyeṣha bhāgavatottamaḥ(11.2.45)[v20]“One who sees God everywhere and in all beings is the highest spiritualist.” For such advanced spiritualists whose minds are completely absorbed in God-consciousness, the person making the sacrifice, the object of the sacrifice, the instruments of the sacrifice, the sacrificial fire, and the act of sacrifice, are all perceived as non-different from God.Having explained the spirit in which sacrifice is to be done, Lord Krishna now relates the different kinds of sacrifice people perform in this world for purification.",factually objects world made maya material energy god energy one energetic also different for example light energy fire it considered different fire exists outside but also reckoned part fire hence rays sun enter room window people say the sun come here bundling sunrays sun the energy distinct energetic yet part itthe soul energy spiritual energy called jīva śhakti shree krishna states verse mahaprabhu stated jīvatattva śhakti kṛiṣhṇatattva śhaktimāngītāviṣhṇupurāṇādi tāhāte pramāṇa chaitanya charitāmṛit ādi leela lord krishna energetic soul energy this stated bhagavad gita viṣhṇu purāṇ etc thus soul also simultaneously one different god hence whose minds fully absorbed godconsciousness see whole world unity god nondifferent the śhrīmad bhāgavatam states sarvabhūteṣhu yaḥ paśhyed bhagavadbhāvam ātmanaḥbhūtāni bhagavatyātmanyeṣha bhāgavatottamaḥ one sees god everywhere beings highest spiritualist for advanced spiritualists whose minds completely absorbed godconsciousness person making sacrifice object sacrifice instruments sacrifice sacrificial fire act sacrifice perceived nondifferent godhaving explained spirit sacrifice done lord krishna relates different kinds sacrifice people perform world purification

However, people vary in their understanding, and hence perform sacrifice in different manners with dissimilar consciousness. Persons with lesser understanding, and wanting material rewards, make offerings to the celestial gods.Others with deeper understanding of the meaning of yajña offer their own selves as sacrifice to the Supreme. This is called ātma samarpaṇ, or ātmāhutī, or offering one’s soul to God. Yogi Shri Krishna Prem explained this very well: “In this world of dust and din, whenever one makes ātmāhutī in the flame of divine love, there is an explosion, which is grace, for no true ātmāhutī can ever go in vain.” But what is the process of offering one’s own self as sacrifice? This is performed by surrendering oneself completely to God. Such surrender has six aspects to it, which have been explained in verse 18.66.

Others offer the objects, viz sound etc., in the fires of the organs.","Fire transforms the nature of things consigned into it. In external ritualistic Vedic sacrifices, it physically consumes oblations offered to it. In the internal practice of spirituality, fire is symbolic. The fire of self-discipline burns the desires of the senses.Here, Shree Krishna distinguishes between two diametrically opposite approaches to spiritual elevation. One is the path of negation of the senses, which is followed in the practice of haṭha yog. In this type of yajña (sacrifice), the actions of the senses are suspended, except for the bare maintenance of the body. The mind is completely withdrawn from the senses and made introvertive, by force of will-power.Opposite to this is the practice of bhakti yog. In this second type of yajña, the senses are made to behold the glory of the Creator that manifests in every atom of his creation. The senses no longer remain as instruments for material enjoyment; rather they are sublimated to perceive God in everything. In verse 7.8, Shree Krishna says: raso ‘ham apsu kaunteya “Arjun, know me to be the taste in water.” Accordingly, bhakti yogis practice to behold God through all their senses, in everything they see, hear, taste, feel, and smell. This yajña of devotion is simpler than the path of haṭha yog; it is joyous to perform, and involves a smaller risk of downfall from the path.

While haṭha yogis strive to restrain the senses with brute will-power, jñāna yogis accomplish the same goal with the repeated practice of discrimination based on knowledge. They engage in deep contemplation upon the illusory nature of the world, and the identity of the self as distinct from the body, mind, intellect, and ego. The senses are withdrawn from the world, and the mind is engaged in meditation upon the self. The goal is to become practically situated in self-knowledge, in the assumption that the self is identical with the Supreme Ultimate reality. As aids to contemplation, they chant aphorisms such as: tattvamasi “I am That,” (Chhāndogya Upaniṣhad 6.8.7)[v21] and ahaṁ brahmāsmi “I am the Supreme Entity.” (Bṛihadāraṇyak Upaniṣhad 1.4.10) [v22]The practice of jñāna yog is a very difficult path, which requires a very determined and trained intellect.

Shree Krishna brings Arjun to the understanding that sacrifices can take on hundreds of forms, but when they are dedicated to God, they become means of purification of the mind and senses and elevation of the soul. In this verse, he mentions three such yajñas that can be performed.Dravya yajña. There are those who are inclined toward earning wealth and donating it in charity toward a divine cause. Although they may engage in large and complicated business endeavors, yet their inner motivation remains to serve God with the wealth they earn. In this manner, they offer their propensity for earning money as sacrifice to God in devotion. John Wesley, the British preacher and founder of the Methodist Church would instruct his followers: “Make all you can. Save all you can. Give all you can.”Yog yajña. In Indian philosophy the Yog Darśhan is one of the six philosophical treatises written by six learned sages. Jaimini wrote “Mīmānsā Darśhan,” Ved Vyas wrote “Vedānt Darśhan,” Gautam wrote “Nyāya Darśhan,” Kanad wrote “Vaiśheṣhik Darśhan,” Kapil wrote “Sānkhya Darśhan,” and Patañjali wrote “Yog Darśhan.” The Patañjali Yog Darśhan describes an eight-fold path, called aṣhṭāṅg yog, for spiritual advancement, starting with physical techniques and ending in conquest of the mind. Some people find this path attractive and practice it as sacrifice. However, Patañjali Yog Darśhan clearly states:samādhisiddhirīśhvara praṇidhānāt (2.45)[v24]“To attain perfection in Yog, you must surrender to God.” So when persons inclined toward aṣhṭang yog learn to love God, they offer their yogic practice as yajña in the fire of devotion. An example of this is the yogic system “Jagadguru Kripaluji Yog,” where the physical postures of aṣhṭaṅg yog are practiced as yajña to God, along with the chanting of his divine names. Such a combination of yogic postures along with devotion results in the physical, mental, and spiritual purification of the practitioner.Jñāna yajña. Some persons are inclined toward the cultivation of knowledge. This propensity finds its perfect employment in the study of scriptures for enhancing one’s understanding and love for God. sā vidyā tanmatiryayā (Bhāgavatam 4.29.49)[v25] “True knowledge is that which increases our devotion to God.” Thus, studiously inclined sādhaks engage in the sacrifice of knowledge, which when imbued with the spirit of devotion, leads to loving union with God.",human beings differ natures motivations activities professions aspirations sanskārs tendencies carrying forward past lives shree krishna brings arjun understanding sacrifices take hundreds forms dedicated god become means purification mind senses elevation soul in verse mentions three yajñas performeddravya yajña there inclined toward earning wealth donating charity toward divine cause although may engage large complicated business endeavors yet inner motivation remains serve god wealth earn in manner offer propensity earning money sacrifice god devotion john wesley british preacher founder methodist church would instruct followers make save give can yog yajña in indian philosophy yog darśhan one six philosophical treatises written six learned sages jaimini wrote mīmānsā darśhan ved vyas wrote vedānt darśhan gautam wrote nyāya darśhan kanad wrote vaiśheṣhik darśhan kapil wrote sānkhya darśhan patañjali wrote yog darśhan the patañjali yog darśhan describes eightfold path called aṣhṭāṅg yog spiritual advancement starting physical techniques ending conquest mind some people find path attractive practice sacrifice however patañjali yog darśhan clearly states samādhisiddhirīśhvara praṇidhānāt to attain perfection yog must surrender god so persons inclined toward aṣhṭang yog learn love god offer yogic practice yajña fire devotion an example yogic system jagadguru kripaluji yog physical postures aṣhṭaṅg yog practiced yajña god along chanting divine names such combination yogic postures along devotion results physical mental spiritual purification practitionerjñāna yajña some persons inclined toward cultivation knowledge this propensity finds perfect employment study scriptures enhancing one understanding love god sā vidyā tanmatiryayā bhāgavatam true knowledge increases devotion god thus studiously inclined sādhaks engage sacrifice knowledge imbued spirit devotion leads loving union god

This world ceases to exist for one who does not perform sacrifices. What to speak of the other (world), O best among the Kurus (Arjuna)!","The secret of sacrifice, as mentioned previously, is the understanding that it should be performed for the pleasure of God, and then the remnants can be taken as his prasād (grace). For example, devotees of the Lord partake of food after offering it to him. After cooking the food, they place it on the altar and pray to God to accept their offering. In their mind, they meditate on the sentiment that God is actually eating from the plate. At the end of the offering, the remnants on the plate are accepted as prasād, or the grace of God. Partaking of such nectar-like prasād leads to illumination, purification, and spiritual advancement.In the same mood, devotees offer clothes to God and then wear them as his prasād. They install his deity in their house, and then live in it with the attitude that their home is the temple of God. When objects or activities are offered as sacrifice to God, then the remnants, or prasād, are a nectar-like blessing for the soul. The great devotee Uddhav told Shree Krishna: tvayopabhukta-srag-gandha-vāso ’laṅkāra-charchitāḥ uchchhiṣhṭa-bhojino dāsās tava māyāṁ jayema hi  (Bhāgavatam 11.6.46)[v26]“I will only eat, smell, wear, live in, and talk about objects that have first been offered to you. In this way, by accepting the remnants as your prasād, I will easily conquer Maya.” Those who do not perform sacrifice remain entangled in the fruitive reactions of work and continue to experience the torments of Maya.",the secret sacrifice mentioned previously understanding performed pleasure god remnants taken prasād grace for example devotees lord partake food offering after cooking food place altar pray god accept offering in mind meditate sentiment god actually eating plate at end offering remnants plate accepted prasād grace god partaking nectarlike prasād leads illumination purification spiritual advancementin mood devotees offer clothes god wear prasād they install deity house live attitude home temple god when objects activities offered sacrifice god remnants prasād nectarlike blessing soul the great devotee uddhav told shree krishna tvayopabhuktasraggandhavāso laṅkāracharchitāḥ uchchhiṣhṭabhojino dāsās tava māyāṁ jayema hi bhāgavatam i eat smell wear live talk objects first offered in way accepting remnants prasād i easily conquer maya those not perform sacrifice remain entangled fruitive reactions work continue experience torments maya

4,33,श्रेयान्द्रव्यमयाद्यज्ञाज्ज्ञानयज्ञ: परन्तप | सर्वं कर्माखिलं पार्थ ज्ञाने परिसमाप्यते ॥33॥,"O destroyer of enemies, Knowledge considered as a sacrifice is greater than sacrifices requiring materials. O son of Prtha, all actions in their totality culminate in Knowledge.","Shree Krishna now puts the previously described sacrifices in proper perspective. He tells Arjun that it is good to do physical acts of devotion, but not good enough. Ritualistic ceremonies, fasts, mantra chants, holy pilgrimages, are all fine, but if they are not performed with knowledge, they remain mere physical activities. Such mechanical activities are better than not doing anything at all, but they are not sufficient to purify the mind.Many people chant God’s name on rosary beads, sit in recitations of the scriptures, visit holy places, and perform worship ceremonies, with the belief that the physical act itself is sufficient for liberating them from material bondage. However, Saint Kabir rejects this idea very eloquently:mālā pherata yuga phirā, phirā na mana kā pher,kar kā manakā ḍāri ke, manakā manakā pher [v27]“O spiritual aspirant, you have been rotating the chanting beads for many ages, but the mischief of the mind has not ceased. Now put those beads down, and rotate the beads of the mind.” Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj says:bandhan aur mokṣha kā, kāraṇ manahi bakhānyāte kauniu bhakti karu, karu man te haridhyān(Bhakti Shatak verse 19)[v28]“The cause of bondage and liberation is the mind. Whatever form of devotion you do, engage your mind in meditating upon God.”Devotional sentiments are nourished by the cultivation of knowledge. For example, let us say that it is your birthday party, and people are coming and handing you gifts. Someone comes and gives you a ragged bag. You look at it disdainfully, thinking it is insignificant in comparison to the other wonderful gifts you have received. That person requests you to look inside the bag. You open it and find a stack of one hundred notes of $100 denomination. You immediately hug the bag to your chest, and say, “This is the best gift I have received.” Knowledge of its contents developed love for the object. Similarly, cultivating knowledge of God and our relationship with him nurtures devotional sentiments. Hence, Shree Krishna explains to Arjun that sacrifices performed in knowledge are superior to the sacrifice of material things.  He now explains the process of acquiring knowledge.",shree krishna puts previously described sacrifices proper perspective he tells arjun good physical acts devotion not good enough ritualistic ceremonies fasts mantra chants holy pilgrimages fine not performed knowledge remain mere physical activities such mechanical activities better not anything not sufficient purify mindmany people chant god name rosary beads sit recitations scriptures visit holy places perform worship ceremonies belief physical act sufficient liberating material bondage however saint kabir rejects idea eloquently mālā pherata yuga phirā phirā na mana kā pher kar kā manakā ḍāri ke manakā manakā pher o spiritual aspirant rotating chanting beads many ages mischief mind not ceased now put beads rotate beads mind jagadguru shree kripaluji maharaj says bandhan aur mokṣha kā kāraṇ manahi bakhānyāte kauniu bhakti karu karu man te haridhyān bhakti shatak verse the cause bondage liberation mind whatever form devotion engage mind meditating upon god devotional sentiments nourished cultivation knowledge for example let us say birthday party people coming handing gifts someone comes gives ragged bag you look disdainfully thinking insignificant comparison wonderful gifts received that person requests look inside bag you open find stack one hundred notes denomination you immediately hug bag chest say this best gift i received knowledge contents developed love object similarly cultivating knowledge god relationship nurtures devotional sentiments hence shree krishna explains arjun sacrifices performed knowledge superior sacrifice material things he explains process acquiring knowledge
4,34,तद्विद्धि प्रणिपातेन परिप्रश्नेन सेवया | उपदेक्ष्यन्ति ते ज्ञानं ज्ञानिनस्तत्त्वदर्शिन: ॥34॥,"Know that through prostration, inquiry and service. The wise ones who have realized the Truth will impart the Knowledge to you.","On hearing that sacrifice should be performed in knowledge, the natural question that follows is, how can we obtain spiritual knowledge? Shree Krishna gives the answer in this verse. He says: 1) Approach a spiritual master. 2) Inquire from him submissively. 3) Render service to him.The Absolute Truth cannot be understood merely by our own contemplation. The Bhāgavatam states:anādyavidyā yuktasya puruṣhasyātma vedanamsvato na sambhavād anyas tattva-jño jñāna-do bhavet(11.22.10)[v29]“The intellect of the soul is clouded by ignorance from endless lifetimes. Covered with nescience, the intellect cannot overcome its ignorance simply by its own effort. One needs to receive knowledge from a God-realized Saint who knows the Absolute Truth.”The Vedic scriptures advise us repeatedly on the importance of the Guru on the spiritual path.āchāryavān puruṣho vedaḥ(Chhāndogya Upaniṣhad 6.14.2)[v30]“Only through a Guru can you understand the Vedas.” The Pañchadaśhī states:tatpādāmburu hadvandva sevā nirmala chetasāmsukhabodhāya tattvasya viveko ’yaṁ vidhīyate(1.2)[v31]“Serve the Guru with a pure mind, giving up doubts. He will then bring you great happiness by bestowing knowledge of the scriptures and discrimination.” Jagadguru Shankaracharya stated: yāvat gururna kartavyo tāvanmuktirna labhyate[v32] “Until you surrender to a Guru you cannot be liberated from the material energy.”One of the most magnanimous graces of God is when he brings the soul in contact with a true Guru. But the process of transfer of spiritual knowledge from the teacher to the student is very different from that of material knowledge. Secular education does not require deep respect for the teacher. The transmission of knowledge can be purchased simply by paying the teacher’s fees. However, spiritual edification is not imparted to the student by a mechanical teaching process, nor is it purchased for a price. It is revealed in the heart of the disciple by the Guru’s grace, when the disciple develops humility, and the Guru is pleased with the service attitude of the disciple. That is why Prahlad Maharaj said:naiṣhāṁ matis tāvad urukramāṅghriṁ spṛiśhatyanarthāpagamo yadarthaḥmahīyasāṁ pāda rajo ’bhiṣhekaṁ niṣhkiñchanānāṁ na vṛiṇīta yāvat(Bhāgavatam 7.5.32)[v33]“Until we bathe ourselves in the dust of the lotus feet of a Saint, we can never have an experience of the transcendental platform.” Hence, in this verse Shree Krishna mentions the need for approaching a Guru with reverence, inquiring about the Truth from him with humility, and pleasing him by rendering service.",on hearing sacrifice performed knowledge natural question follows obtain spiritual knowledge shree krishna gives answer verse he says approach spiritual master inquire submissively render service himthe absolute truth not understood merely contemplation the bhāgavatam states anādyavidyā yuktasya puruṣhasyātma vedanamsvato na sambhavād anyas tattvajño jñānado bhavet the intellect soul clouded ignorance endless lifetimes covered nescience intellect not overcome ignorance simply effort one needs receive knowledge godrealized saint knows absolute truth the vedic scriptures advise us repeatedly importance guru spiritual pathāchāryavān puruṣho vedaḥ chhāndogya upaniṣhad only guru understand vedas the pañchadaśhī states tatpādāmburu hadvandva sevā nirmala chetasāmsukhabodhāya tattvasya viveko yaṁ vidhīyate serve guru pure mind giving doubts he bring great happiness bestowing knowledge scriptures discrimination jagadguru shankaracharya stated yāvat gururna kartavyo tāvanmuktirna labhyate until surrender guru not liberated material energy one magnanimous graces god brings soul contact true guru but process transfer spiritual knowledge teacher student different material knowledge secular education not require deep respect teacher the transmission knowledge purchased simply paying teacher fees however spiritual edification not imparted student mechanical teaching process purchased price it revealed heart disciple guru grace disciple develops humility guru pleased service attitude disciple that prahlad maharaj said naiṣhāṁ matis tāvad urukramāṅghriṁ spṛiśhatyanarthāpagamo yadarthaḥmahīyasāṁ pāda rajo bhiṣhekaṁ niṣhkiñchanānāṁ na vṛiṇīta yāvat bhāgavatam until bathe dust lotus feet saint never experience transcendental platform hence verse shree krishna mentions need approaching guru reverence inquiring truth humility pleasing rendering service

Tadviṣhṇoḥ paramaṁ padaṁ sadā paśhyanti sūrayaḥ “Those who have realized God always remain in God-consciousness.”Under the illusion of Maya, we see the world as separate from God, and establish friendship or enmity with other human beings depending upon whether they satisfy or harm our self-interest. Divine knowledge that comes with enlightenment changes our perspective and vision of the world. Enlightened Saints see the world as the energy of God, and utilize whatever comes their way in the service of God. They also see all human beings as parts of God and harbor a divine attitude toward everyone. Thus, Hanuman says:sīyā rāmamaya saba jaga jānī, karauñ pranāma jori juga pānī. (Ramayan)[v34]“I see the forms of Lord Ram and Mother Sita in everyone, and so I fold my hands and offer my respects to all.”",just darkness never engulf sun similarly illusion never overcome soul attained enlightenment tadviṣhṇoḥ paramaṁ padaṁ sadā paśhyanti sūrayaḥ those realized god always remain godconsciousness under illusion maya see world separate god establish friendship enmity human beings depending upon whether satisfy harm selfinterest divine knowledge comes enlightenment changes perspective vision world enlightened saints see world energy god utilize whatever comes way service god they also see human beings parts god harbor divine attitude toward everyone thus hanuman says sīyā rāmamaya saba jaga jānī karauñ pranāma jori juga pānī ramayan i see forms lord ram mother sita everyone i fold hands offer respects

The material energy subjects everyone to the three-fold miseries: ādiātmik—miseries due to one’s own body and mind, ādibhautik—miseries due to other living entities, and ādidaivik—miseries due to climactic and environmental conditions. In this state of material bondage, there is no respite for the soul, and endless lifetimes have gone by being subjected to these conditions. Like a football being kicked around the field, the soul is elevated to the celestial abodes, dropped to the hellish planes of existence, and brought back to the earthly realm, etc. according to its karmas of righteous or sinful deeds.Divine knowledge provides the boat to cross over the material ocean. The ignorant perform karmas and get bound by them. Performing the same karmas as a yajña to God liberates the knowledgeable. Thus, knowledge becomes the means of cutting material bondage. The Kaṭhopaniṣhad states:vijñānasārathiryastu manaḥ pragrahavān naraḥso ’dhvanaḥ pāramāpnoti tadviṣhṇoḥ paramaṁ padam (1.3.9)“Illumine your intellect with divine knowledge; then with the illumined intellect, control the unruly mind, to cross over the material ocean and reach the divine realm.”",material existence like vast ocean one tossed around waves birth disease old age death the material energy subjects everyone threefold miseries due one body mind due living entities due climactic environmental conditions in state material bondage respite soul endless lifetimes gone subjected conditions like football kicked around field soul elevated celestial abodes dropped hellish planes existence brought back earthly realm etc according karmas righteous sinful deedsdivine knowledge provides boat cross material ocean the ignorant perform karmas get bound performing karmas yajña god liberates knowledgeable thus knowledge becomes means cutting material bondage the kaṭhopaniṣhad states vijñānasārathiryastu manaḥ pragrahavān naraḥso dhvanaḥ pāramāpnoti tadviṣhṇoḥ paramaṁ padam illumine intellect divine knowledge illumined intellect control unruly mind cross material ocean reach divine realm

If we endeavor to exhaust these karmas by reaping their results, it will take many more lifetimes, and in the meantime further karmas will accumulate in an endless process. But Shree Krishna assures Arjun that knowledge has the power to burn our heap of karmas in this lifetime itself. That is because knowledge of the soul and its relationship with God leads us to surrender to him. When we surrender to God, he burns our stockpile of endless lifetimes of karmas and releases us from material bondage.",even spark fire potential become major conflagration burn huge heap combustible material in great fire london began little flame small bakery grew consigned flames houses churches city officeswe heap karmas attached us consisting reactions sinful righteous deeds performed us infinite lifetimes if endeavor exhaust karmas reaping results take many lifetimes meantime karmas accumulate endless process but shree krishna assures arjun knowledge power burn heap karmas lifetime that knowledge soul relationship god leads us surrender when surrender god burns stockpile endless lifetimes karmas releases us material bondage
4,38,न हि ज्ञानेन सदृशं पवित्रमिह विद्यते | तत्स्वयं योगसंसिद्ध: कालेनात्मनि विन्दति ॥38॥,"Indeed, there is nothing purifying here comparable to Knowledge. One who has become perfected after a (long) time through yoga, realizes That by himself in his own heart.","Knowledge has the power to purify, elevate, liberate, and unite a person with God. It is thus supremely sublime and pure. But a distinction needs to be made between two kinds of knowledge—theoretical information and practical realization.There is one kind of knowledge that is acquired by reading the scriptures and hearing from the Guru. This theoretical information is insufficient by itself. It is just as if someone has memorized a cookbook but has never entered the kitchen. Such theoretical knowledge of cooking does not help in satiating one’s hunger. Similarly, one may acquire theoretical knowledge on the topics of the soul, God, Maya, karm, jñāna, and bhakti from the Guru, but that by itself does not make a person God-realized. When one practices sādhanā in accordance with the theory, it results in purification of the mind. Then, from within one gets realization of the nature of the self and its relationship with God. The Sage Patañjali states:śhrutānumāna-prajñābhyām anya-viṣhayā viśheṣhārthatvāt (Yog Darśhan 1.49)[v36]“The knowledge attained by realization from within through the practice of Yog is far superior to theoretical knowledge of the scriptures.” Such realized knowledge is being extolled by Shree Krishna as the purest sublime thing.",knowledge power purify elevate liberate unite person god it thus supremely sublime pure but distinction needs made two kinds information practical realizationthere one kind knowledge acquired reading scriptures hearing guru this theoretical information insufficient it someone memorized cookbook never entered kitchen such theoretical knowledge cooking not help satiating one hunger similarly one may acquire theoretical knowledge topics soul god maya karm jñāna bhakti guru not make person godrealized when one practices sādhanā accordance theory results purification mind then within one gets realization nature self relationship god the sage patañjali states śhrutānumānaprajñābhyām anyaviṣhayā viśheṣhārthatvāt yog darśhan the knowledge attained realization within practice yog far superior theoretical knowledge scriptures such realized knowledge extolled shree krishna purest sublime thing
4,39,श्रद्धावान् लभते ज्ञानं तत्पर: संयतेन्द्रिय: | ज्ञानं लब्ध्वा परां शान्तिमचिरेणाधिगच्छति ॥39॥,"The man who has faith, is diligent and has control over the organs, attains Knowledge. Achieving Knowledge, one soon attains supreme Peace.","Shree Krishna now introduces the concept of faith in the context of knowledge. Not all spiritual truths are immediately perceptible; some of them can only be experienced after having attained sufficient elevation on the path. If we only accept what we can presently verify or comprehend, we will be bereft of the higher spiritual secrets. Faith helps us accept what we cannot understand at present. Jagadguru Shankaracharya has defined faith as follows:guru vedānta vākyeṣhu dṛiḍho viśhvāsaḥ śhraddhā [v37]“Faith means firm confidence in the words of the Guru and the scriptures.” When such faith is placed upon a wrong personality, it can lead to disastrous consequences. But when it is placed on the true Guru, it opens the pathway for eternal welfare.However, blind faith is not a desirable thing. Before placing it on any Guru, we must use our intellect to confirm that the Guru has realized the Absolute Truth, and he is teaching it in accordance with the eternal Vedic scriptures. Once this is confirmed, then we should strive to deepen our faith in such a Guru, and surrender to God under his guidance. The Shvetashvatar Upaniṣhad states:yasya deve parā bhaktir yathā deve tathā gurautasyaite kathitā hyarthāḥ prakāśhante mahātmanaḥ(6.23)[v38]“The imports of all the Vedic knowledge is revealed within the hearts of those who engage with unflinching faith in devotion toward Guru and God.”",shree krishna introduces concept faith context knowledge not spiritual truths immediately perceptible experienced attained sufficient elevation path if accept presently verify comprehend bereft higher spiritual secrets faith helps us accept not understand present jagadguru shankaracharya defined faith follows guru vedānta vākyeṣhu dṛiḍho viśhvāsaḥ śhraddhā faith means firm confidence words guru scriptures when faith placed upon wrong personality lead disastrous consequences but placed true guru opens pathway eternal welfarehowever blind faith not desirable thing before placing guru must use intellect confirm guru realized absolute truth teaching accordance eternal vedic scriptures once confirmed strive deepen faith guru surrender god guidance the shvetashvatar upaniṣhad states yasya deve parā bhaktir yathā deve tathā gurautasyaite kathitā hyarthāḥ prakāśhante mahātmanaḥ the imports vedic knowledge revealed within hearts engage unflinching faith devotion toward guru god

Neither this world nor the next nor happiness exists for one who has a doubting mind.","The Bhakti Rasāmṛit Sindhu classifies sādhaks into three classes based on the degree of faith and knowledge:śhāstre yuktau cha nipuṇaḥ sarvathā dṛiḍha-niśhchayaḥprauḍha-śhraddho ‘dhikārī yaḥ sa bhaktāvuttamo mataḥyaḥ śhāstrādiṣhvanipuṇaḥ śhraddhāvān sa tu madhyamaḥyo bhavet komala śhraddhaḥ sa kaniṣhṭho nigadyate (1.2.17-19)[v39]“The highest sādhak (spiritual aspirant) is one who possesses knowledge of the scriptures and is also endowed with firm faith. The medium class sādhak is one who does not have knowledge of the scriptures, but is endowed with faith toward God and Guru. The lowest class sādhak is one, who neither has scriptural knowledge nor is endowed with faith.” For the third category, Shree Krishna says that such persons cannot attain peace either in this life or hereafter.Even worldly activities require the exercise of faith. For example, if a woman goes to a restaurant and places an order for the meal, she has faith that the restaurant will not mix poison in her food. If, however, she is besieged with doubts and wants to subject every food item to a chemical test first, how will she ever enjoy and finish her meal? Similarly, a man goes to barber shop to get a shave, and sits on the chair while the barber moves the sharp edge of his knife over his throat. Now, if the man doubts the barber and suspects his having the intention of murder, he will not be able to sit still for the barber to be able to shave him. Hence, Shree Krishna says in this verse that for the doubting person there is no happiness either in this world or in the next.",the bhakti rasāmṛit sindhu classifies sādhaks three classes based degree faith knowledge śhāstre yuktau cha sarvathā dhikārī sa bhaktāvuttamo śhāstrādiṣhvanipuṇaḥ śhraddhāvān sa tu madhyamaḥyo bhavet komala śhraddhaḥ sa kaniṣhṭho nigadyate the highest sādhak spiritual aspirant one possesses knowledge scriptures also endowed firm faith the medium class sādhak one not knowledge scriptures endowed faith toward god guru the lowest class sādhak one neither scriptural knowledge endowed faith for third category shree krishna says persons not attain peace either life hereaftereven worldly activities require exercise faith for example woman goes restaurant places order meal faith restaurant not mix poison food if however besieged doubts wants subject every food item chemical test first ever enjoy finish meal similarly man goes barber shop get shave sits chair barber moves sharp edge knife throat now man doubts barber suspects intention murder not able sit still barber able shave hence shree krishna says verse doubting person happiness either world next

Shree Krishna says that their work performed in devotion do not bind them.Only those actions bind one in karma, which are performed to fulfill one’s self-interest. When work is done only for the pleasure of God, such action becomes free from all karmic reaction. They are like multiplying numbers with 0 (zero). If we multiply 0 with 10, the result will be 0; if we multiply 0 with 1000, the result will remain 0; and if we multiply 0 with 1 million, the result will still be 0. Similarly, the works that enlightened souls perform in the world do not bind them, because they are offered to God in the fire of Yog, i.e. they are done for the pleasure of God. Thus, although doing all kinds of works, the Saints remain unfettered from the bonds of karma.",karm actions involved prescribed rituals social duties sanyās means renounce yog means unite god here shree krishna used word yogasanyasta karmāṇaṁ referring renounce ritualistic karm dedicating body mind soul god such persons every action service god shree krishna says work performed devotion not bind themonly actions bind one karma performed fulfill one selfinterest when work done pleasure god action becomes free karmic reaction they like multiplying numbers zero if multiply result multiply result remain multiply million result still similarly works enlightened souls perform world not bind offered god fire yog ie done pleasure god thus although kinds works saints remain unfettered bonds karma

In this sense, the heart is the source of compassion, love, sympathy, and all the good emotions. So when Shree Krishna mentions doubts that have arisen in the heart, he means doubts that have arisen in the mind, which is the subtle machine that resides in the region of the heart.In the role of being the Spiritual Master of Arjun, the Lord has imparted to his disciple the knowledge of how to gain insightful wisdom from the practice of karm yog. He now advises Arjun to utilize both wisdom and faith to cleave out the doubts from his mind. Then, he gives the call of action and asks Arjun to rise up and do his duty in the spirit of karm yog. The dual instructions to both refrain from action and to engage in action still create confusion in Arjun’s mind, which he reveals in the opening of the next chapter.",the use word heart not imply physical machine housed chest pumps blood body the vedas state one physical brain resides head subtle mind resides region heart that reason love hatred one experiences pain heart in sense heart source compassion love sympathy good emotions so shree krishna mentions doubts arisen heart means doubts arisen mind subtle machine resides region heartin role spiritual master arjun lord imparted disciple knowledge gain insightful wisdom practice karm yog he advises arjun utilize wisdom faith cleave doubts mind then gives call action asks arjun rise duty spirit karm yog the dual instructions refrain action engage action still create confusion arjun mind reveals opening next chapter

Tell me for certain that one which is better between these two.","This is the fifth of Arjun’s sixteen questions.  Shree Krishna praised both the renunciation of works and work with devotion.  Arjun is confused by these apparently equivocal instructions and wishes to understand which of the two is more auspicious for him.  Let us review the context of the question.The first chapter described the nature of Arjun’s grief and created the setting for Shree Krishna to begin to relate spiritual knowledge to him.  In the second chapter, Shree Krishna revealed to Arjun the science of the self and explained that since the soul is immortal, nobody would die in the war, and hence it was foolish to lament.  He then reminded Arjun that his karm (social duty) as a warrior was to fight the war on the side of righteousness.  But, since karm binds one to the fruits of actions, Shree Krishna encouraged Arjun to dedicate the fruits of his works to God.  His actions would then become karm-yog, or “united with God through works.” In the third chapter, the Supreme Lord explained that performing one’s duties is necessary because it helps to purify the mind.  But He also said that a person who has already developed purity of mind is not obliged to perform any social duty (verse 3.17).  In the fourth chapter, the Lord explained the various kinds of sacrifices (works that can be done for the pleasure of God).  He concluded by saying that sacrifice performed in knowledge is better than mechanical ritualistic sacrifice.  He also said that all sacrifice ends in the knowledge of one’s relationship with God.  Finally, in verse 4.41, He introduced the principle of karm sanyās, in which ritualistic duties and social obligations are renounced and one engages in devotional service with the body, mind, and soul.  These instructions perplexed Arjun.  He thought that karm sanyās (renunciation of works) and karm-yog (work in devotion) have opposite natures, and it is not possible to perform both simultaneously.  Hence, he raises his doubt before Shree Krishna.",this fifth arjun sixteen questions shree krishna praised renunciation works work devotion arjun confused apparently equivocal instructions wishes understand two auspicious let us review context questionthe first chapter described nature arjun grief created setting shree krishna begin relate spiritual knowledge in second chapter shree krishna revealed arjun science self explained since soul immortal nobody would die war hence foolish lament he reminded arjun karm social duty warrior fight war side righteousness but since karm binds one fruits actions shree krishna encouraged arjun dedicate fruits works god his actions would become karmyog united god works in third chapter supreme lord explained performing one duties necessary helps purify mind but he also said person already developed purity mind not obliged perform social duty verse in fourth chapter lord explained various kinds sacrifices works done pleasure god he concluded saying sacrifice performed knowledge better mechanical ritualistic sacrifice he also said sacrifice ends knowledge one relationship god finally verse he introduced principle karm sanyās ritualistic duties social obligations renounced one engages devotional service body mind soul these instructions perplexed arjun he thought karm sanyās renunciation works karmyog work devotion opposite natures not possible perform simultaneously hence raises doubt shree krishna

Between the two, Karma-yoga, however, excels over renunciation of actions.","In this verse, Shree Krishna compares karm sanyās and karm-yog.  It is a very deep verse; so let’s understand it one word at a time.A karm yogi is one who does both, spiritual and social, duties.  Social duties are done with the body while the mind is attached to God.  Jagadguru Kripaluji Maharaj states:sochu mana yaha karm mama saba lakhata hari guru pyāre   (Sādhan Bhakti Tattva) “Dear one!  Think always that all your actions are being observed by God and Guru.”  This is the sādhanā of karm-yog, by which we gradually elevate ourselves from bodily consciousness to spiritual consciousness. Karm sanyās is for elevated souls, who have already risen beyond the bodily platform.  A karm sanyāsī is one who discards social duties due to complete absorption in God, and engages entirely in the performance of spiritual duties (devotional service to God).  This sentiment of karm sanyās was nicely expressed by Lakshman, when Lord Ram asked him to fulfill his worldly duties:more sabai eka tumha swāmī, dīnabandhu ura antarayāmī   (Ramayan)Lakshman said to Ram, “You are my Master, Father, Mother, Friend, and everything.  I will only fulfill my duty toward You with all my might.  So please do not tell me about any of my bodily duties.”Those who practice karm sanyās do not consider themselves to be the body, and as a result, they do not feel obligated to discharge their bodily duties.  Such karm sanyāsīs dedicate their full time and energy to spirituality, while karm yogis have to split their time between worldly and spiritual duties.  The karm sanyāsīs can thus move much faster toward God, while the karm yogis are encumbered with social duties. However, in this verse, Shree Krishna extols karm-yog beyond karm sanyās and recommends it to Arjun as the preferred path.  This is because karm sanyāsīs are exposed to a danger.  If, having renounced their duties they cannot absorb their mind in God, they are left neither here nor there.  In India, there are tens of thousands of such sadhus, who felt they were detached, and thus, renounced the world, but their mind was not yet attached to God.  Consequently, they could not experience the divine bliss of the spiritual path.  And so, although wearing the saffron clothes of mendicants, they indulge in grossly sinful activities such as smoking opium.  Only the ignorant mistake their sloth as detachment from the world. On the other hand, karm yogis do both their worldly duties and spiritual practice.  So if their mind turns away from spirituality, at least they have their work to fall back upon.  Karm-yog is thus the safer path for majority of the people, while karm sanyās is only to be pursued under the expert guidance of a Guru.",in verse shree krishna compares karm sanyās karmyog it deep verse let understand one word timea karm yogi one spiritual social duties social duties done body mind attached god jagadguru kripaluji maharaj states sochu mana yaha karm mama saba lakhata hari guru pyāre sādhan bhakti tattva dear one think always actions observed god guru this sādhanā karmyog gradually elevate bodily consciousness spiritual consciousness karm sanyās elevated souls already risen beyond bodily platform a karm sanyāsī one discards social duties due complete absorption god engages entirely performance spiritual duties devotional service god this sentiment karm sanyās nicely expressed lakshman lord ram asked fulfill worldly duties sabai eka tumha swāmī dīnabandhu ura antarayāmī ramayan lakshman said ram you master father mother friend everything i fulfill duty toward you might so please not tell bodily duties those practice karm sanyās not consider body result not feel obligated discharge bodily duties such karm sanyāsīs dedicate full time energy spirituality karm yogis split time worldly spiritual duties the karm sanyāsīs thus move much faster toward god karm yogis encumbered social duties however verse shree krishna extols karmyog beyond karm sanyās recommends arjun preferred path this karm sanyāsīs exposed danger if renounced duties not absorb mind god left neither in india tens thousands sadhus felt detached thus renounced world mind not yet attached god consequently could not experience divine bliss spiritual path and although wearing saffron clothes mendicants indulge grossly sinful activities smoking opium only ignorant mistake sloth detachment world on hand karm yogis worldly duties spiritual practice so mind turns away spirituality least work fall back upon karmyog thus safer path majority people karm sanyās pursued expert guidance guru

Anyone who properly resorts to even one (of them) gets the result of both.","Here, Shree Krishna uses the word sānkhya to refer to karm sanyās, or the renunciation of actions with the cultivation of knowledge.  It is important to understand here that renunciation is of two kinds:  phalgu vairāgya and yukt vairāgya.  Phalgu vairāgya is where people look upon the world as cumbersome, and renounce it with the desire of getting rid of responsibilities and hardships.  Such phalgu vairāgya is an escapist attitude and is unstable.  The renunciation of such persons is motivated by the desire to run away from difficulties.  When such persons encounter difficulties on the spiritual path, they become detached from there as well, and desire to run back to worldly life.  Yukt vairāgya is where people see the whole world as the energy of God.  They do not see what they possess as belonging to them, and do not wish to enjoy it for themselves.  Instead, they are motivated by the desire to serve God with whatever He has given to them.  Yukt vairāgya is stable and undeterred by difficulties.The karm yogis, while conducting their daily duties externally, develop the sentiment of yukt vairāgya, or stable renunciation.  They see themselves as the servants and God as the enjoyer, and hence they become fixed in the consciousness of doing everything for His pleasure.  Thus, their internal state becomes the same as that of the karm sanyāsīs, who are completely absorbed in divine consciousness.  Externally, they may appear to be worldly people, but internally they are no less than sanyāsīs. The Puranas and Itihās relate the examples of great kings in Indian history, who, though externally discharging their kingly duties with diligence and living in royal opulence, were mentally completely absorbed in God-consciousness.  Prahlad, Dhruv, Ambarish, Prithu, Vibheeshan, Yudhishthir, etc. were all such exemplary karm yogis.  The Shreemad Bhagavatam states: gṛihītvāpīndriyair arthān yo na dveṣhṭi na hṛiṣhyativiṣhṇor māyām idaṁ paśhyan sa vai bhāgavatottamaḥ   (11.2.48)“One who accepts the objects of the senses, neither yearning for them nor running away from them, in the divine consciousness that everything is the energy of God and is to be used in His service, such a person is the highest devotee.”  Thus, the truly learned see no difference between karm-yog and karm sanyās.  By following one of them, the results of both are achieved.",here shree krishna uses word sānkhya refer karm sanyās renunciation actions cultivation knowledge it important understand renunciation two kinds phalgu vairāgya yukt vairāgya phalgu vairāgya people look upon world cumbersome renounce desire getting rid responsibilities hardships such phalgu vairāgya escapist attitude unstable the renunciation persons motivated desire run away difficulties when persons encounter difficulties spiritual path become detached well desire run back worldly life yukt vairāgya people see whole world energy god they not see possess belonging not wish enjoy instead motivated desire serve god whatever he given yukt vairāgya stable undeterred difficultiesthe karm yogis conducting daily duties externally develop sentiment yukt vairāgya stable renunciation they see servants god enjoyer hence become fixed consciousness everything his pleasure thus internal state becomes karm sanyāsīs completely absorbed divine consciousness externally may appear worldly people internally less sanyāsīs the puranas itihās relate examples great kings indian history though externally discharging kingly duties diligence living royal opulence mentally completely absorbed godconsciousness prahlad dhruv ambarish prithu vibheeshan yudhishthir etc exemplary karm yogis the shreemad bhagavatam states gṛihītvāpīndriyair arthān yo na dveṣhṭi na hṛiṣhyativiṣhṇor māyām idaṁ paśhyan sa vai bhāgavatottamaḥ one accepts objects senses neither yearning running away divine consciousness everything energy god used his service person highest devotee thus truly learned see difference karmyog karm sanyās by following one results achieved

The meditative man equipped with yoga attains Brahman without delay.","Living in a cave in the Himalayas, a yogi may feel that he has renounced, but the test of that renunciation comes when he returns to the city.  For instance, one sadhu practiced austerities for twelve years in the mountains of Garhwal.  He came down to Haridwar to participate in the holy fair called Kumbh Melā.  In the hustle and bustle of the fair, someone accidentally placed his shoe on the sadhu’s bare foot.  The sadhu  was infuriated, and screamed, “Are you blind?  Can you not see where you are going?”  Later he repented for permitting anger to overcome him, and lamented, “Twelve years of austerities in the mountains got washed away by living one day in the city!”  The world is the arena where our renunciation gets tested.In this verse, Shree Krishna says that while performing one’s duties in the world, a person should slowly learn to rise above anger, greed, and desire.  Instead, if one first gives up duties, it is very difficult to purify the mind; and without a pure mind, true detachment remains a distant dream. We are all propelled to work by our nature.  Arjun was a warrior, and if he had artificially renounced his duty, to retire to the forest, his nature would make him work there as well.  He would probably gather a few tribesmen and declare himself their king.  Instead, it would be more fruitful to use his natural inclinations and talents in the service of God.  So the Lord instructs him, “Continue to fight, but make one change.  At first, you came to this battleground on the presumption of saving a kingdom.  Now, instead, simply dedicate your service unselfishly to God.  In this way, you will naturally purify the mind and achieve true renunciation from within.” A tender and unripe fruit clings fast to the tree that bears and nourishes it.  But the same fruit, when fully ripe, severs its connection from its sustainer.  Similarly from the material existence, the karm yogi gets the experience that matures into wisdom.  Just as sound sleep is only possible for those who have worked hard, deep meditation comes to those who have purified their minds through karm-yog.",living cave himalayas yogi may feel renounced test renunciation comes returns city for instance one sadhu practiced austerities twelve years mountains garhwal he came haridwar participate holy fair called kumbh melā in hustle bustle fair someone accidentally placed shoe sadhu bare foot the sadhu infuriated screamed are blind can not see going later repented permitting anger overcome lamented twelve years austerities mountains got washed away living one day city the world arena renunciation gets testedin verse shree krishna says performing one duties world person slowly learn rise anger greed desire instead one first gives duties difficult purify mind without pure mind true detachment remains distant dream we propelled work nature arjun warrior artificially renounced duty retire forest nature would make work well he would probably gather tribesmen declare king instead would fruitful use natural inclinations talents service god so lord instructs continue fight make one change at first came battleground presumption saving kingdom now instead simply dedicate service unselfishly god in way naturally purify mind achieve true renunciation within a tender unripe fruit clings fast tree bears nourishes but fruit fully ripe severs connection sustainer similarly material existence karm yogi gets experience matures wisdom just sound sleep possible worked hard deep meditation comes purified minds karmyog

5,10,ब्रह्मण्याधाय कर्माणि सङ्गं त्यक्त्वा करोति य: | लिप्यते न स पापेन पद्मपत्रमिवाम्भसा ॥10॥,"One who acts by dedicating actions to Brahman and by renouncing attachment, he does not become polluted by sin, just as a lotus leaf is not by water.","Both Hindu and Buddhist scriptures abound with analogies of the lotus flower.  The word is used as a respectful appellation while describing various parts of God’s divine body.  Hence charaṇ-kamal means “lotus-like feet,” kamalekṣhaṇa means “lotus-like eyes,” kar-kamal means “lotus-like hands,” etc.Another word for the lotus flower is paṅkaj, which means “born from mud.”  The lotus flower grows from the mud found at the bottom of the lake, yet it rises above the water and blossoms toward the sun.  Thus, the lotus flower is often used in Sanskrit literature as an example of something that is born amidst the dirt, and rises above it while retaining its beautiful purity. Further, the lotus plant has large leaves that float atop the water surface of the lake.  Lotus leaves are used in Indian villages for plates, as they are waterproof, and liquid poured on them does not soak through, but runs off.  The beauty of the lotus leaf is that, although the lotus owes its birth, growth, and sustenance to the water, the leaf does not permit itself to be wetted.  Water poured on the lotus leaf runs off the side, due to the small hair growing on its surface. With the help of the beautiful analogy of the lotus leaf, Shree Krishna says that just as it floats atop the surface of the lake, but does not allow itself to be wetted by the water, similarly, the karm yogis remain untouched by sin, although performing all kinds of works, because they perform their works in divine consciousness.",both hindu buddhist scriptures abound analogies lotus flower the word used respectful appellation describing various parts god divine body hence charaṇkamal means lotuslike feet kamalekṣhaṇa means lotuslike eyes karkamal means lotuslike hands etcanother word lotus flower paṅkaj means born mud the lotus flower grows mud found bottom lake yet rises water blossoms toward sun thus lotus flower often used sanskrit literature example something born amidst dirt rises retaining beautiful purity further lotus plant large leaves float atop water surface lake lotus leaves used indian villages plates waterproof liquid poured not soak runs the beauty lotus leaf although lotus owes birth growth sustenance water leaf not permit wetted water poured lotus leaf runs side due small hair growing surface with help beautiful analogy lotus leaf shree krishna says floats atop surface lake not allow wetted water similarly karm yogis remain untouched sin although performing kinds works perform works divine consciousness
5,11,कायेन मनसा बुद्ध्या केवलैरिन्द्रियैरपि | योगिन: कर्म कुर्वन्ति सङ्गं त्यक्त्वात्मशुद्धये ॥11॥,"By giving up attachment, the yogis undertake work merely through the body, mind, intellect and even the organs, for the purification of themselves.","The yogis understand that pursuing material desires in the pursuit of happiness is as futile as chasing the mirage in the desert.  Realizing this, they renounce selfish desires, and perform all their actions for the pleasure of God, who alone is the bhoktāraṁ yajña tapasām (Supreme enjoyer of all activities).  However, in this verse, Shree Krishna brings a new twist to the samarpaṇ (dedication of works to God).  He says the enlightened yogis perform their works for the purpose of purification.  How then do the works get dedicated to God? The fact is that God needs nothing from us.  He is the Supreme Lord of everything that exists and is perfect and complete in Himself.  What can a tiny soul offer to the Almighty God, that God does not already possess?  Hence, it is customary while making an offering to God to say:  tvadiyaṁ vastu govinda tubhyameva samarpitaṁ “O God, I am offering Your item back to You.”  Expressing a similar sentiment, Saint Yamunacharya states:mama nātha yad asti yo ’smyahaṁ sakalam taddhī tavaiva mādhavaniyata-svam iti prabuddha-dhāir atha vā kiṁ nu samarpayāmi te (Śhrī Stotra Ratna, 50)“O Lord Vishnu, husband of the Goddess of Fortune, when I was in ignorance, I thought I would give You many things.  But now when I have gained knowledge, I realize that everything I own is already Yours.  What then can I offer to You?”However, there is one activity that is in our hands and not in God’s hands; that is the purification of our own heart (mind and intellect).  When we purify our heart and engage it in devotion to God, it pleases Him more than anything else.  Realizing this, the great yogis make purification of their heart as the foremost goal, not out of selfishness, rather for the pleasure of God.Thus, the yogis understand that the biggest thing they can give to God is the purity of their own hearts and they work to achieve it.  In the Ramayan, there is a sweet illustration of this principle.  Lord Ram found Sugreev to be somewhat frightened before the battle of Lanka so He consoled him in the following manner:piśhāchān dānavān yakṣhān pṛithivyāṁ chaiva rākṣhasānaṅgugreṇa tānhanyā michchhan harī gaṇeśhvaraḥ   (Vālmīki Ramayan)Lord Ram said, “If I, the Supreme Lord, merely bend the little finger of My left hand, what to speak of Ravan and Kumbhakarn, all the demons in the world will die.”  Sugreev responded, “If that is the case, my Lord, then in order to kill Ravan, what is the need for collecting this army?”  The Lord replied, “That is merely to give you all the opportunity to engage in devotional service for your own purification.  However, do not assume that I need your help in annihilating these demons.” Our only permanent asset is the purity that we achieve.  It goes with us into the next life, while all material assets get left behind.  Hence in the final analysis, the success and failure of our life is determined by the extent to which we manage to achieve purity of heart.  With this in view, elevated yogis welcome adverse circumstances, because they see them as opportunities for purifying the heart.  Saint Kabir states:nindak niyare rākhiye āngan kuṭi chhabāyanita sābun pānī binā nirmala kare subhāya“If you are desirous of quickly cleansing your heart, cultivate the company of a critic.  When you tolerate his acrimonious words, your heart will be cleansed without water and soap.”  Thus, when purification of the heart is made the prime motive of actions, adversarial circumstances are then welcomed as God-sent opportunities for further progress, and one remains in equanimity in both success and failure.  As we work for the pleasure of God, the heart gets purified; and as the heart gets purified, we naturally offer the results of all our actions to the Supreme Lord.",the yogis understand pursuing material desires pursuit happiness futile chasing mirage desert realizing renounce selfish desires perform actions pleasure god alone bhoktāraṁ yajña tapasām supreme enjoyer activities however verse shree krishna brings new twist samarpaṇ dedication works god he says enlightened yogis perform works purpose purification how works get dedicated god the fact god needs nothing us he supreme lord everything exists perfect complete himself what tiny soul offer almighty god god not already possess hence customary making offering god say tvadiyaṁ vastu govinda tubhyameva samarpitaṁ o god i offering your item back you expressing similar sentiment saint yamunacharya states mama nātha yad asti yo smyahaṁ sakalam taddhī tavaiva mādhavaniyatasvam iti prabuddhadhāir atha vā kiṁ nu samarpayāmi te śhrī stotra ratna o lord vishnu husband goddess fortune i ignorance i thought i would give you many things but i gained knowledge i realize everything i already yours what i offer you however one activity hands not god hands purification heart mind intellect when purify heart engage devotion god pleases him anything else realizing great yogis make purification heart foremost goal not selfishness rather pleasure godthus yogis understand biggest thing give god purity hearts work achieve in ramayan sweet illustration principle lord ram found sugreev somewhat frightened battle lanka he consoled following manner piśhāchān dānavān yakṣhān pṛithivyāṁ chaiva rākṣhasānaṅgugreṇa tānhanyā michchhan harī gaṇeśhvaraḥ vālmīki ramayan lord ram said if i supreme lord merely bend little finger my left hand speak ravan kumbhakarn demons world die sugreev responded if case lord order kill ravan need collecting army the lord replied that merely give opportunity engage devotional service purification however not assume i need help annihilating demons our permanent asset purity achieve it goes us next life material assets get left behind hence final analysis success failure life determined extent manage achieve purity heart with view elevated yogis welcome adverse circumstances see opportunities purifying heart saint kabir states nindak niyare rākhiye āngan kuṭi chhabāyanita sābun pānī binā nirmala kare subhāya if desirous quickly cleansing heart cultivate company critic when tolerate acrimonious words heart cleansed without water soap thus purification heart made prime motive actions adversarial circumstances welcomed godsent opportunities progress one remains equanimity success failure as work pleasure god heart gets purified heart gets purified naturally offer results actions supreme lord

Hence, the creatures become deluded.","God is not responsible either for anyone’s virtuous deeds or sinful actions.  God’s work in this regard is threefold:  1) He provides the soul with the power to act.  2) Once we have performed actions with the power supplied to us, He notes our actions.  3) He gives us the results of our karmas.The individual soul has the freedom to perform good or bad actions by the exercise of its own free will.  That free will is the basis of the play of creation and it accounts for the varieties of consciousness amongst the souls in existence.  God’s work is like that of an umpire in a cricket match.  He keeps giving the results, “Four runs!”  “Six runs!”  “He’s out!”  The umpire cannot be blamed for the decision, for it was based upon the way the player performed. One may ask why God granted free will to the soul.  It is because the soul is a tiny part of God and it possesses His qualities to a minuscule extent.  God is abhijña swarāṭ (supremely independent), and so the soul also possesses a tiny amount of independence to utilize its senses, mind, and intellect in the manner it wishes. Also, without free will there can be no love.  A machine cannot love since it has no independence to choose.  Only a personality that has the ability to choose possesses the option to love.  Since God has created us to love Him, He has endowed us with free will.  The exercise of our own free will results in good and bad deeds, and we must not blame God for them. In ignorance, some souls do not even realize that they possess the freedom to choose their actions and hold God responsible for their mistakes.  Others realize they possess a free will, but they harbor the pride of doership in the egoistic notion of being the body.  This is again a sign of ignorance.  Shree Krishna explains next how such ignorance can be dispelled.",god not responsible either anyone virtuous deeds sinful actions god work regard threefold he provides soul power act once performed actions power supplied us he notes actions he gives us results karmasthe individual soul freedom perform good bad actions exercise free that free basis play creation accounts varieties consciousness amongst souls existence god work like umpire cricket match he keeps giving results four runs six runs he the umpire not blamed decision based upon way player performed one may ask god granted free soul it soul tiny part god possesses his qualities minuscule extent god abhijña swarāṭ supremely independent soul also possesses tiny amount independence utilize senses mind intellect manner wishes also without free love a machine not love since independence choose only personality ability choose possesses option love since god created us love him he endowed us free the exercise free results good bad deeds must not blame god in ignorance souls not even realize possess freedom choose actions hold god responsible mistakes others realize possess free harbor pride doership egoistic notion body this sign ignorance shree krishna explains next ignorance dispelled

The rules for those who enter the renounced order of sanyās state that they should not perform the ritualistic karm kāṇḍ activities; in fact they should not touch fire at all, not even for the purpose of cooking. And they should subsist on alms instead. However, Shree Krishna states in this verse that merely giving up the sacrificial fire does not make one a sanyāsī (renunciant).Who are true yogis, and who are true sanyāsīs? There is much confusion in this regard. People say, “This swamiji is phalāhārī (one who eats only fruits and nothing else), and so he must be an elevated yogi.” “This bābājī (renunciant) is dūdhāhārī (subsists on milk alone), and hence he must be an even higher yogi.” “This guruji is pavanāhārī (does not eat, lives only on the breath), and so he must definitely be God-realized.” “This sadhu is a nāgā bābā (ascetic who does not wear clothes), and thus he is perfectly renounced.” However, Shree Krishna dismisses all these concepts. He says that such external acts of asceticism do not make anyone either a sanyāsī or a yogi. Those who can renounce the fruits of their actions, by offering them to God, are the true renunciants and yogis.Nowadays Yoga has become the buzz word in the western world. Numerous Yoga studios have sprung up in every town of every country of the world. Statistics reveal that one out of every ten persons in America is practicing Yoga. But this word “Yoga” does not exist in the Sanskrit scriptures. The actual word is “Yog,” which means “union.” It refers to the union of the individual consciousness with the divine consciousness. In other words, a yogi is one whose mind is fully absorbed in God. It also follows that such a yogi’s mind is naturally detached from the world. Hence, the true yogi is also the true sanyāsī.Persons who perform karm yog do all activities in the spirit of humble service to God without any desire whatsoever for rewards. Even though they may be gṛihasthas (living with a family), such persons are true yogis and the real renunciants.",the ritualistic activities described vedas include fire sacrifices agnihotra yajna the rules enter renounced order sanyās state not perform ritualistic karm kāṇḍ activities fact not touch fire not even purpose cooking and subsist alms instead however shree krishna states verse merely giving sacrificial fire not make one sanyāsī renunciant who true yogis true sanyāsīs there much confusion regard people say this swamiji phalāhārī one eats fruits nothing else must elevated yogi this bābājī renunciant dūdhāhārī subsists milk alone hence must even higher yogi this guruji pavanāhārī not eat lives breath must definitely godrealized this sadhu nāgā bābā ascetic not wear clothes thus perfectly renounced however shree krishna dismisses concepts he says external acts asceticism not make anyone either sanyāsī yogi those renounce fruits actions offering god true renunciants yogisnowadays yoga become buzz word western world numerous yoga studios sprung every town every country world statistics reveal one every ten persons america practicing yoga but word yoga not exist sanskrit scriptures the actual word yog means union it refers union individual consciousness divine consciousness in words yogi one whose mind fully absorbed god it also follows yogi mind naturally detached world hence true yogi also true sanyāsīpersons perform karm yog activities spirit humble service god without desire whatsoever rewards even though may gṛihasthas living family persons true yogis real renunciants
6,2,यं संन्यासमिति प्राहुर्योगं तं विद्धि पाण्डव | न ह्यसंन्यस्तसङ्कल्पो योगी भवति कश्चन ॥2॥,"That which they call monasticism, know that to be Sannyasa Yoga, O Pandava, For, nobody who has not given up expectations can be a yogi.","A sanyāsī is one who renounces the pleasures of the mind and senses. But mere renunciation is not the goal, nor is it sufficient to reach the goal. Renunciation means that our running in the wrong direction has stopped. We were searching for happiness in the world, and we understood that there is no happiness in material pleasures, so we stopped running toward the world. But, the destination is not reached just by stopping. The destination of the soul is God-realization. The process of going toward God—taking the mind toward him—is the path of Yog. Those who have incomplete knowledge of the goal of life, look upon renunciation as the highest goal of spirituality. Those who truly understand the goal of life, regard God-realization as the ultimate goal of their spiritual endeavor.In the purport to verse 5.4, it was explained that there are two kinds of renunciation—phalgu vairāgya and yukt vairāgya. Phalgu vairāgya is that where worldly objects are seen as objects of Maya, the material energy, and hence renounced because they are detrimental to spiritual progress. Yukt vairāgya is that where everything is seen as belonging to God, and hence meant to be utilized in his service. In the first kind of renunciation, one would say, “Give up money. Do not touch it. It is a form of Maya, and it impedes the path of spirituality.” In the second kind of renunciation, one would say, “Money is also a form of the energy of God. Do not waste it or throw it away; utilize whatever you have in your possession for the service of God.”Phalgu vairāgya is unstable, and can easily revert to attachment for the world. The name “Phalgu” comes from a river in the city of Gaya, in the state of Bihar in India. The river Phalgu runs below the surface. From atop, it seems as if there is no water, but if you dig a few feet, you encounter the stream below. Similarly, many persons renounce the world to go and live in monasteries, only to find that in a few years the renunciation has vanished and the mind is again attached to the world. Their detachment was phalgu vairāgya. Finding the world to be troublesome and miserable, they desired to get away from it by taking shelter in monastery. But when they found spiritual life also to be difficult and arduous, they got detached from spirituality as well. Then there are others who establish their loving relationship with God. Motivated by the desire to serve him, they renounce the world to live in a monastery. Their renunciation is yukt vairāgya. They usually continue the journey even if they face difficulties.In the first line of this verse, Shree Krishna states that a real sanyāsī (renunciant) is one who is a yogi, i.e. one who is uniting the mind with God in loving service. In the second line, Shree Krishna states that one cannot be a yogi without giving up material desires. If there are material desires in the mind, then it will naturally run toward the world. Since it is the mind that has to be united with God, this is only possible if the mind is free from all material desires. Thus, to be a yogi one has to be a sanyāsī from within; and one can only be a sanyāsī if one is a yogi.",a sanyāsī one renounces pleasures mind senses but mere renunciation not goal sufficient reach goal renunciation means running wrong direction stopped we searching happiness world understood happiness material pleasures stopped running toward world but destination not reached stopping the destination soul godrealization the process going toward mind toward path yog those incomplete knowledge goal life look upon renunciation highest goal spirituality those truly understand goal life regard godrealization ultimate goal spiritual endeavorin purport verse explained two kinds vairāgya yukt vairāgya phalgu vairāgya worldly objects seen objects maya material energy hence renounced detrimental spiritual progress yukt vairāgya everything seen belonging god hence meant utilized service in first kind renunciation one would say give money do not touch it form maya impedes path spirituality in second kind renunciation one would say money also form energy god do not waste throw away utilize whatever possession service god phalgu vairāgya unstable easily revert attachment world the name phalgu comes river city gaya state bihar india the river phalgu runs surface from atop seems water dig feet encounter stream similarly many persons renounce world go live monasteries find years renunciation vanished mind attached world their detachment phalgu vairāgya finding world troublesome miserable desired get away taking shelter monastery but found spiritual life also difficult arduous got detached spirituality well then others establish loving relationship god motivated desire serve renounce world live monastery their renunciation yukt vairāgya they usually continue journey even face difficultiesin first line verse shree krishna states real sanyāsī renunciant one yogi ie one uniting mind god loving service in second line shree krishna states one not yogi without giving material desires if material desires mind naturally run toward world since mind united god possible mind free material desires thus yogi one sanyāsī within one sanyāsī one yogi
6,3,आरुरुक्षोर्मुनेर्योगं कर्म कारणमुच्यते | योगारूढस्य तस्यैव शम: कारणमुच्यते ॥3॥,"For the sage who wishes to ascend to (Dhyana-) yoga, action is said to be the means. For that person, when he has ascended to (Dhyana-)yoga, inaction alone is said to be the means.","In chapter 3, verse 3, Shree Krishna mentioned that there are two paths for attaining welfare—the path of contemplation and the path of action. Between these, he recommended to Arjun to follow the path of action. Again in chapter 5, verse 2, he declared it to be the better path. Does this mean that we must keep doing work all our life? Anticipating such a question, Shree Krishna sets the limits for it. When we perform karm yog, it leads to the purification of the mind and the ripening of spiritual knowledge. But once the mind has been purified and we advance in Yog, then we can leave karm yog and take to karm sanyās. Material activities now serve no purpose and meditation now becomes the means.So the path we must follow filters down to a matter of our eligibility and Shree Krishna explains the criteria of eligibility in this verse. He says that for those who are aspiring for Yog, the path of karm yog is more suitable; and those who are elevated in Yog, the path of karm sanyās is more suitable.The word Yog refers to both the goal and the process to reach the goal. When we talk of it as being the goal, we use Yog as meaning “union with God.” And when we talk of it as being the process, we use Yog as meaning the “path” to union with God.In this second context, Yog is like a ladder we climb to reach God. At the lowest rung, the soul is caught in worldliness, with the consciousness absorbed in mundane matter. The ladder of Yog takes the soul from that level to the stage where the consciousness is absorbed in the divine. The various rungs of the ladder have different names, but Yog is a term common to them all. Yog-ārurukṣhu are those sādhaks who aspire for union with God and have just begun climbing the ladder. Yog-ārūḍha are those who have become elevated on the ladder.So, how do we understand when one is elevated in the science of Yog?

So an easy criterion of evaluating the state of one’s mind is to check whether it has become free from all material desires. A person will be considered detached from the world when one no longer craves for sense objects nor is inclined to perform any actions for attaining them. Such a person ceases to look for opportunities to create circumstances to enjoy sensual pleasures, eventually extinguishes all thoughts of enjoying sense objects, and also dissolves the memories of previous enjoyments.The mind now no longer gushes into self-centered activities at the urge of the senses. When we achieve this level of mastery over the mind, we will be considered elevated in Yog.",as mind becomes attached god yog naturally becomes detached world so easy criterion evaluating state one mind check whether become free material desires a person considered detached world one longer craves sense objects inclined perform actions attaining such person ceases look opportunities create circumstances enjoy sensual pleasures eventually extinguishes thoughts enjoying sense objects also dissolves memories previous enjoymentsthe mind longer gushes selfcentered activities urge senses when achieve level mastery mind considered elevated yog
6,5,उद्धरेदात्मनात्मानं नात्मानमवसादयेत् | आत्मैव ह्यात्मनो बन्धुरात्मैव रिपुरात्मन: ॥5॥,One should save oneself by oneself; one should not lower oneself. For oneself is verily one's own friend; oneself is verily one's own enemy.,"We are responsible for our own elevation or debasement. Nobody can traverse the path of God-realization for us. Saints and Gurus show us the way, but we have to travel it ourselves. There is a saying in Hindi: ek peḍa do pakṣhī baiṭhe, ek guru ek chelā, apanī karanī guru utare, apanī karanī chelā[v.01] “There are two birds sitting on a tree—one Guru and one disciple. The Guru will descend by his own works, and the disciple will also only be able to climb down by his own karmas.”We have had innumerable lifetimes before this one, and God-realized Saints were always present on Earth. At any period of time, if the world is devoid of such Saints, then the souls of that period cannot become God-realized. How then can they fulfill the purpose of human life, which is God-realization? Thus, God ensures that God-realized Saints are always present in every era, to guide the sincere seekers and inspire humanity. So, in infinite past lifetimes, many times we must have met God-realized Saints and yet we did not become God-realized. This means that the problem was not lack of proper guidance, but either our reticence in accepting it or working according to it. Thus, we must first accept responsibility for our present level of spirituality, or lack thereof. Only then will we gain the confidence that if we have brought ourselves to our present state, we can also elevate ourselves by our efforts.When we suffer reversals on the path of spiritual growth, we tend to complain that others have caused havoc to us, and they are our enemies. However, our biggest enemy is our own mind. It is the saboteur that thwarts our aspirations for perfection. Shree Krishna states that, on the one hand, as the greatest benefactor of the soul, the mind has the potential of giving us the most benefit; on the other hand, as our greatest adversary, it also has the potential for causing the maximum harm. A controlled mind can accomplish many beneficial endeavors, whereas an uncontrolled mind can degrade the consciousness with most ignoble thoughts.In order to be able to use it as a friend, it is important to understand the mind’s nature. Our mind operates at four levels:Mind: When it creates thoughts, we call it mana, or the mind.Intellect: When it analyses and decides, we call it buddhi, or intellect.Chitta: When it gets attached to an object or person, we call it chitta.Ego: When it identifies with the bodily identifications and becomes proud of things like wealth, status, beauty, and learning, we call it ahankār, or ego.These are not four separate entities. They are simply four levels of functioning of the one mind. Hence, we may refer to them all together as the mind, or as the mind-intellect, or as the mind-intellect-ego, or as the mind-intellect-chitta-ego. They all refer to the same thing.The use of the word ego here is different from its connotation in Freudian psychology. Sigmund Freud (1856 – 1939), an Austrian neurologist, proposed the first theory of psychology regarding how the mind works. According to him, the ego is the “real self” that bridges the gap between our untamed desires (Id) and the value system that is learnt during childhood (Superego).Various scriptures describe the mind in one of these four ways for the purpose of explaining the concepts presented there. They are all referring to the same internal apparatus within us, which is together called antaḥ karaṇ, or the mind. For example:The Pañchadaśhī refers to all four together as the mind, and states that it is the cause of material bondage.In the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna repeatedly talks of the mind and the intellect as being two things, and emphasizes the need to surrender both to God.The Yog Darśhan, while analyzing the different elements of nature, talks of three entities: mind, intellect, and ego.Shankaracharya, while explaining the apparatus available to the soul, classifies the mind into four—mind, intellect, chitta and ego.So when Shree Krishna says that we must use the mind to elevate the self, he means we must use the higher mind to elevate the lower mind. In other words, we must use the intellect to control the mind. How this can be done has been explained in detail in verses 2.41 to 2.44 and again in verse 3.43.",we responsible elevation debasement nobody traverse path godrealization us saints gurus show us way travel there saying hindi ek peḍa pakṣhī baiṭhe ek guru ek chelā apanī karanī guru utare apanī karanī chelā there two birds sitting guru one disciple the guru descend works disciple also able climb karmas we innumerable lifetimes one godrealized saints always present earth at period time world devoid saints souls period not become godrealized how fulfill purpose human life godrealization thus god ensures godrealized saints always present every era guide sincere seekers inspire humanity so infinite past lifetimes many times must met godrealized saints yet not become godrealized this means problem not lack proper guidance either reticence accepting working according thus must first accept responsibility present level spirituality lack thereof only gain confidence brought present state also elevate effortswhen suffer reversals path spiritual growth tend complain others caused havoc us enemies however biggest enemy mind it saboteur thwarts aspirations perfection shree krishna states one hand greatest benefactor soul mind potential giving us benefit hand greatest adversary also potential causing maximum harm a controlled mind accomplish many beneficial endeavors whereas uncontrolled mind degrade consciousness ignoble thoughtsin order able use friend important understand mind nature our mind operates four levels mind when creates thoughts call mana mindintellect when analyses decides call buddhi intellectchitta when gets attached object person call chittaego when identifies bodily identifications becomes proud things like wealth status beauty learning call ahankār egothese not four separate entities they simply four levels functioning one mind hence may refer together mind mindintellect mindintellectego mindintellectchittaego they refer thingthe use word ego different connotation freudian psychology sigmund freud austrian neurologist proposed first theory psychology regarding mind works according ego real self bridges gap untamed desires id value system learnt childhood superego various scriptures describe mind one four ways purpose explaining concepts presented they referring internal apparatus within us together called antaḥ karaṇ mind for example the pañchadaśhī refers four together mind states cause material bondagein bhagavad gita shree krishna repeatedly talks mind intellect two things emphasizes need surrender godthe yog darśhan analyzing different elements nature talks three entities mind intellect egoshankaracharya explaining apparatus available soul classifies mind intellect chitta egoso shree krishna says must use mind elevate self means must use higher mind elevate lower mind in words must use intellect control mind how done explained detail verses verse
6,6,बन्धुरात्मात्मनस्तस्य येनात्मैवात्मना जित: | अनात्मनस्तु शत्रुत्वे वर्ते तात्मैव शत्रुवत् ॥6॥,"Of him, by whom has been conquered his very self by the self, his self is the friend of his self. But, for one who has not conquered his self, his self itself acts inimically like an enemy.","We dissipate a large portion of our thought power and energy in combating people whom we perceive as enemies and potentially harmful to us. The Vedic scriptures say the biggest enemies—lust, anger, greed, envy, illusion, etc.—reside in our own mind. These internal enemies are even more pernicious than the outer ones. The external demons may injure us for some time, but the demons sitting within our own mind have the ability to make us live in constant wretchedness. We all know people who had everything favorable in the world, but lived miserable lives because their own mind tormented them incessantly through depression, hatred, tension, anxiety, and stress. The Vedic philosophy lays great emphasis on the ramification of thoughts. Illness is not only caused by viruses and bacteria, but also by the negativities we harbor in the mind. If someone accidentally throws a stone at you, it may hurt for a few minutes, but by the next day, you will probably have forgotten about it. However, if someone says something unpleasant, it may continue to agitate your mind for years. This is the immense power of the thoughts. In the Buddhist scripture, the Dhammapada (1.3), the Buddha also expresses this truth vividly: “I have been insulted! I have been hurt! I have been beaten! I have been robbed! Misery does not cease in those who harbor such thoughts. When we nourish hatred in our mind, our negative thoughts do more damage to us than the object of our hatred. It has been very sagaciously stated: “Resentment is like drinking poison and hoping that the other person dies.” The problem is that most people do not even realize that their own uncontrolled mind is causing them so much harm. Hence, Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj advises: mana ko mano shatru usaki sunahu jani kachhu pyare (Sadhan Bhakti Tattva)[v1] “Dear spiritual aspirant, look on your uncontrolled mind as your enemy. Do not come under its sway.” However, the same mind has the potential of becoming our best friend, if we bring it under control of the intellect, through spiritual practice. The more powerful an entity is, the greater is the danger of its misuse, and also the greater is the scope for its utilization. Since the mind is such a powerful machine fitted into our bodies, it can work as a two-edged sword. Thus, those who slide to demoniac levels do so because of their own mind while those who attain sublime heights also do so because of their purified minds. Accordingly, Franklin D. Roosevelt, former President of America, expressed this very nicely: “Men are not prisoners of fate, but only prisoners of their own minds.” In this verse, Shree Krishna enlightens Arjun about the potential harm and benefits our mind can bestow upon us. In the following three verses, Shree Krishna describes the symptoms of one who is yog-aru?ha (advanced in Yog).",we dissipate large portion thought power energy combating people perceive enemies potentially harmful us the vedic scriptures say biggest anger greed envy illusion mind these internal enemies even pernicious outer ones the external demons may injure us time demons sitting within mind ability make us live constant wretchedness we know people everything favorable world lived miserable lives mind tormented incessantly depression hatred tension anxiety stress the vedic philosophy lays great emphasis ramification thoughts illness not caused viruses bacteria also negativities harbor mind if someone accidentally throws stone may hurt minutes next day probably forgotten however someone says something unpleasant may continue agitate mind years this immense power thoughts in buddhist scripture dhammapada buddha also expresses truth vividly i insulted i hurt i beaten i robbed misery not cease harbor thoughts when nourish hatred mind negative thoughts damage us object hatred it sagaciously stated resentment like drinking poison hoping person dies the problem people not even realize uncontrolled mind causing much harm hence jagadguru shree kripaluji maharaj advises mana ko mano shatru usaki sunahu jani kachhu pyare sadhan bhakti tattva dear spiritual aspirant look uncontrolled mind enemy do not come sway however mind potential becoming best friend bring control intellect spiritual practice the powerful entity greater danger misuse also greater scope utilization since mind powerful machine fitted bodies work twoedged sword thus slide demoniac levels mind attain sublime heights also purified minds accordingly franklin d roosevelt former president america expressed nicely men not prisoners fate prisoners minds in verse shree krishna enlightens arjun potential harm benefits mind bestow upon us in following three verses shree krishna describes symptoms one yogaru ha advanced yog

As long as the mind has not been subdued, a person chases after the sensual perceptions of pleasure and recoils from the perceptions of pain. The yogi who conquers the mind is able to see these fleeting perceptions as the workings of the bodily senses, distinct from the immortal soul, and thus, remain unmoved by them. Such an advanced yogi rises above the dualities of heat and cold, joy and sorrow, etc.There are only two realms in which the mind may dwell—one is the realm of Maya and the other is the realm of God. If the mind rises above the sensual dualities of the world, it can easily get absorbed in God. Thus, Shree Krishna has stated that an advanced yogi’s mind becomes situated in samādhi (deep meditation) upon God.",shree krishna explained verse contact senses sense objects gives mind experience heat cold joy sorrow as long mind not subdued person chases sensual perceptions pleasure recoils perceptions pain the yogi conquers mind able see fleeting perceptions workings bodily senses distinct immortal soul thus remain unmoved such advanced yogi rises dualities heat cold joy sorrow etcthere two realms mind may realm maya realm god if mind rises sensual dualities world easily get absorbed god thus shree krishna stated advanced yogi mind becomes situated samādhi deep meditation upon god

Vijñāna is the realization of that knowledge as an internal awakening and wisdom from within. The intellect of the advanced yogi becomes illumined by both jñāna and vijñāna. Equipped with wisdom, the yogi sees all material objects as modifications of the material energy. Such a yogi does not differentiate between objects based on their attractiveness to the self. The enlightened yogi sees all things in their relationship with God. Since the material energy belongs to God, all things are meant for his service.The word kuṭastha refers to one who distances the mind from the fluctuating perceptions of senses in contact with the material energy, neither seeking pleasurable situations nor avoiding unpleasurable ones. Vijitendriya is one who has subjugated the senses. The word yukt means one who is in constant communion with the Supreme.

6,9,सुहृन्मित्रार्युदासीनमध्यस्थद्वेष्यबन्धुषु | साधुष्वपि च पापेषु समबुद्धिर्विशिष्यते ॥9॥,"He excels who has sameness of view with regard to a benefactor, a friend, a foe, a neutral, an arbiter, the hateful, a relative, good people and even sinners.","It is the nature of the human mind to respond differently to friends and foes. But an elevated yogi’s nature is different. Endowed with realized knowledge of God, the elevated yogi see the whole creation in its unity with God. Thus, they are able to see all living beings with equality of vision. This parity of vision is also of various levels:“All living beings are divine souls, and hence parts of God.” Thus, they are viewed as equal. ātmavat sarva bhūteṣhu yaḥ paśhyati sa paṇḍitaḥ “A true Pundit is one who sees everyone as the soul, and hence similar to oneself.”Higher is the vision: “God is seated in everyone, and hence all are equally respect worthy.”At the highest level, the yogi develops the vision: “Everyone is the form of God.” The Vedic scriptures repeatedly state that the whole world is a veritable form of God: īśhāvāsyam idam sarvaṁ yat kiñcha jagatyāṁ jagat (Īśhopaniṣhad 1)[v2] “The entire universe, with all its living and non-living beings is the manifestation of the Supreme Being, who dwells within it.” puruṣha evedaṁ sarvaṁ (Puruṣh Sūktam)[v3] “God is everywhere in this world, and everything is his energy.” Hence, the highest yogi sees everyone as the manifestation of God. Endowed with this level of vision, Hanuman says: sīyā rāma maya saba jaga jānī (Ramayan)[v4] “I see the face of Sita Ram in everyone.”These categories have been further detailed in the commentary to verse 6.31. Referring to all three of the above categories, Shree Krishna says that the yogi who can maintain an equal vision toward all persons is even more elevated than the yogi mentioned in the previous verse. Having described the state of Yog, starting with the next verse, Shree Krishna describes the practice by which we can achieve that state.",it nature human mind respond differently friends foes but elevated yogi nature different endowed realized knowledge god elevated yogi see whole creation unity god thus able see living beings equality vision this parity vision also various levels all living beings divine souls hence parts god thus viewed equal ātmavat sarva bhūteṣhu yaḥ paśhyati sa paṇḍitaḥ a true pundit one sees everyone soul hence similar oneself higher vision god seated everyone hence equally respect worthy at highest level yogi develops vision everyone form god the vedic scriptures repeatedly state whole world veritable form god īśhāvāsyam idam sarvaṁ yat kiñcha jagatyāṁ jagat īśhopaniṣhad the entire universe living nonliving beings manifestation supreme being dwells within it puruṣha evedaṁ sarvaṁ puruṣh sūktam god everywhere world everything energy hence highest yogi sees everyone manifestation god endowed level vision hanuman says sīyā rāma maya saba jaga jānī ramayan i see face sita ram everyone these categories detailed commentary verse referring three categories shree krishna says yogi maintain equal vision toward persons even elevated yogi mentioned previous verse having described state yog starting next verse shree krishna describes practice achieve state
6,10,योगी युञ्जीत सततमात्मानं रहसि स्थित: | एकाकी यतचित्तात्मा निराशीरपरिग्रह: ॥10॥,"A yogi should constantly concentrate his mind by staying in a solitary place, alone, with mind and body controlled, free from expectations, (and) free from acquisition.","Having stated the characteristics of one who has attained the state of Yog, Shree Krishna now talks about the self-preparation required for it. Mastery in any field requires daily practice. An Olympic swimming champion is not one who goes to the local neighborhood swimming pool once a week on Saturday evenings. Only one who practices for several hours every day achieves the mastery required to win the Olympics. Practice is essential for spiritual mastery as well. Shree Krishna now explains the process of accomplishing spiritual mastery by recommending the daily practice of meditation. The first point he mentions is the need for a secluded place. All day long, we are usually surrounded by a worldly environment; these material activities, people, and conversations, all tend to make the mind more worldly. In order to elevate the mind toward God, we need to dedicate some time on a daily basis for secluded sādhanā.The analogy of milk and water can help elucidate this point. If milk is poured into water, it cannot retain its undiluted identity, for water naturally mixes with it. However, if the milk is kept separate from water and converted into yogurt, and then the yogurt is churned to extract butter, the butter becomes immiscible. It can now challenge the water, “I will sit on your head and float; you can do nothing to me because I have become butter now.” Our mind is like the milk and the world is like water. In contact with the world, the mind gets affected by it and becomes worldly. However, an environment of seclusion, which offers minimal contact with the objects of the senses, becomes conducive for elevating the mind and focusing it upon God. Once sufficient attachment for God has been achieved, one can challenge the world, “I will live amidst all the dualities of Maya, but remain untouched by them.”This instruction for seclusion has been repeated by Shree Krishna in verse 18.52: vivikt sevī laghvāśhī  “Live in a secluded place; control your diet.” There is a beautiful way of practically applying this instruction without disturbing our professional and social works. In our daily schedule, we can allocate some time for sādhanā, or spiritual practice, where we isolate ourselves in a room that is free from worldly disturbances. Shutting ourselves out from the world, we should do sādhanā to purify the mind and solidify its focus upon God. If we practice in this manner for one to two hours every day, we will reap its benefits all through the day even while engaged in worldly activities. In this manner we will be able to retain the elevated state of consciousness that was gathered during the daily sādhanā in isolation from the world.",having stated characteristics one attained state yog shree krishna talks selfpreparation required mastery field requires daily practice an olympic swimming champion not one goes local neighborhood swimming pool week saturday evenings only one practices several hours every day achieves mastery required win olympics practice essential spiritual mastery well shree krishna explains process accomplishing spiritual mastery recommending daily practice meditation the first point mentions need secluded place all day long usually surrounded worldly environment material activities people conversations tend make mind worldly in order elevate mind toward god need dedicate time daily basis secluded sādhanāthe analogy milk water help elucidate point if milk poured water not retain undiluted identity water naturally mixes however milk kept separate water converted yogurt yogurt churned extract butter butter becomes immiscible it challenge water i sit head float nothing i become butter now our mind like milk world like water in contact world mind gets affected becomes worldly however environment seclusion offers minimal contact objects senses becomes conducive elevating mind focusing upon god once sufficient attachment god achieved one challenge world i live amidst dualities maya remain untouched them this instruction seclusion repeated shree krishna verse vivikt sevī laghvāśhī live secluded place control diet there beautiful way practically applying instruction without disturbing professional social works in daily schedule allocate time sādhanā spiritual practice isolate room free worldly disturbances shutting world sādhanā purify mind solidify focus upon god if practice manner one two hours every day reap benefits day even engaged worldly activities in manner able retain elevated state consciousness gathered daily sādhanā isolation world

Śhuchau deśhe means a pure or sanctified place. In the initial stages, the external environment does impact the mind. In later stages of sādhanā, one is able to achieve internal purity even in dirty and unclean places. But for neophytes, clean surroundings help in keeping the mind clean as well. A mat of Kuśh grass provides temperature insulation from the ground, akin to the yoga mats of today. The deer skin atop it deters poisonous pests like snakes and scorpions from approaching while one is absorbed in meditation. If the āsan is too high, there is the risk of falling off; if the āsan is too low, there is danger of disturbance from insects on the ground. Some instructions regarding external seating given in this verse may be somewhat anachronous to modern times, in which case the spirit of the instruction is to be absorbed in the thought of God, while the instructions for the internal practice remain the same.",shree krishna explains verse external practice sādhanā śhuchau deśhe means pure sanctified place in initial stages external environment impact mind in later stages sādhanā one able achieve internal purity even dirty unclean places but neophytes clean surroundings help keeping mind clean well a mat kuśh grass provides temperature insulation ground akin yoga mats today the deer skin atop deters poisonous pests like snakes scorpions approaching one absorbed meditation if āsan high risk falling āsan low danger disturbance insects ground some instructions regarding external seating given verse may somewhat anachronous modern times case spirit instruction absorbed thought god instructions internal practice remain

In sādhanā, there is a tendency to become lazy and doze off to sleep. This happens because the material mind does not initially get as much bliss in contemplation on God as it does while relishing sense objects. This creates the possibility for the mind to become languid when focused on God. Hence, you do not find people dozing off half-way through their meal, but you do see people falling asleep during meditation and the chanting of God’s names. To avoid this, Shree Krishna gives the instruction to sit erect. The Brahma Sūtra also states three aphorisms regarding the posture for meditation:āsīnaḥ sambhavāt  (4.1.7)[v5] “To do sādhanā, seat yourself properly.”achalatvaṁ chāpekṣhya (4.1.9)[v6] “Ensure that you sit erect and still.”dhyānāchcha (4.1.8)[v7] “Seated in this manner, focus the mind in meditation.”There are a number of meditative āsans described in the Hath Yoga Pradeepika, such as padmasan, ardha padmasan, dhyanveer asan, siddhasan, and sukhasan. We may adopt any āsan in which we can comfortably sit, without moving, during the period of the meditation. Maharshi Patañjali states:sthira sukhamāsanam (Patañjali Yog Sūtra 2.46)[v8]“To practice meditation, sit motionless in any posture that you are comfortable in.” Some people are unable to sit on the floor due to knee problems, etc. They should not feel discouraged, for they can even practice meditation while sitting on a chair, provided they fulfill the condition of sitting motionless and erect.In this verse, Shree Krishna states that the eyes should be made to focus on the tip of the nose, and prevented from wandering. As a variation, the eyes can also be kept closed. Both these techniques will be helpful in blocking out worldly distractions.The external seat and posture do need to be appropriate, but meditation is truly a journey within us. Through meditation, we can reach deep within and cleanse the mind of endless lifetimes of dross. By learning to hold the mind in concentration, we can work upon it to harness its latent potential. The practice of meditation helps organize our personality, awaken our inner consciousness, and expand our self-awareness. The spiritual benefits of meditation are described later, in the purport on verse 6.15. Some of the side benefits are:It reins the unbridled mind, and harnesses the thought energy to attain difficult goals.It helps maintain mental balance in the midst of adverse circumstances.It aids in the development of a strong resolve that is necessary for success in life.It enables one to eliminate bad sanskārs and habits, and cultivate good qualities.The best kind of meditation is one where the mind is focused upon God.

Some of the side benefits are:It reins the unbridled mind, and harnesses the thought energy to attain difficult goals.It helps maintain mental balance in the midst of adverse circumstances.It aids in the development of a strong resolve that is necessary for success in life.It enables one to eliminate bad sanskārs and habits, and cultivate good qualities.The best kind of meditation is one where the mind is focused upon God.

6,14,प्रशान्तात्मा विगतभीर्ब्रह्मचारिव्रते स्थित: | मन: संयम्य मच्चित्तो युक्त आसीत मत्पर: ॥14॥,"He should remain seated with a placid mind, free from fear, firm in the vow of a celibate, and with the mind fixed on Me by controlling it through concentration, having Me as the supreme Goal.","Shree Krishna emphasizes the practice of celibacy for success in meditation. The sexual desire facilitates the process of procreation in the animal kingdom, and animals indulge in it primarily for that purpose. In most species, there is a particular mating season; animals do not indulge in sexual activity wantonly. Since humans have greater intellects and the freedom to indulge at will, the activity of procreation is converted into a means of licentious enjoyment. However, the Vedic scriptures lay great emphasis on practicing celibacy. Maharshi Patanjali states:brahmacharya pratiṣhṭhāyāṁ vīrya lābhaḥ (Yog Sūtras 2.38)[v9]“The practice of celibacy leads to great enhancement of energy.”Ayurveda, the Indian science of medicine extolls brahmacharya (the practice of celibacy) for its exceptional health benefits. One of the students of Dhanvantari approached his teacher after finishing his full course of Ayurveda (the ancient Indian science of medicine), and asked: “O Sage, now kindly let me know the secret of health.” Dhanvantari replied: “This seminal energy is verily the ātman. The secret of health lies in preservation of this vital force. He who wastes this vital and precious energy cannot have physical, mental, moral, and spiritual development.” According to Ayurveda, forty drops of blood go into making one drop of semen. Those who waste their semen develop unsteady and agitated prāṇ. They lose their physical and mental energy, and weaken their memory, mind, and intellect. The practice of celibacy leads to a boost of bodily energy, clarity of intellect, gigantic will power, retentive memory, and a keen spiritual intellect. It creates a sparkle in the eyes and a luster on the cheeks.The definition of celibacy is not restricted to mere abstinence from physical indulgence. The Agni Purāṇ states that the eightfold activities related to sex must be controlled: 1) Thinking about it. 2) Talking about it. 3) Joking about it. 4) Envisioning it. 5) Desiring it. 6) Wooing to get someone interested in it. 7) Enticing someone interested in it. 8) Engaging in it. For one to be considered celibate, all these must be shunned. Thus, celibacy not only requires abstinence from sexual intercourse, but also refrainment from masturbation, homosexual acts, and all other sexual practices.Further, Shree Krishna states here that the object of meditation should be God alone. This point is again reiterated in the next verse.",shree krishna emphasizes practice celibacy success meditation the sexual desire facilitates process procreation animal kingdom animals indulge primarily purpose in species particular mating season animals not indulge sexual activity wantonly since humans greater intellects freedom indulge activity procreation converted means licentious enjoyment however vedic scriptures lay great emphasis practicing celibacy maharshi patanjali states brahmacharya pratiṣhṭhāyāṁ vīrya lābhaḥ yog sūtras the practice celibacy leads great enhancement energy ayurveda indian science medicine extolls brahmacharya practice celibacy exceptional health benefits one students dhanvantari approached teacher finishing full course ayurveda ancient indian science medicine asked o sage kindly let know secret health dhanvantari replied this seminal energy verily ātman the secret health lies preservation vital force he wastes vital precious energy not physical mental moral spiritual development according ayurveda forty drops blood go making one drop semen those waste semen develop unsteady agitated prāṇ they lose physical mental energy weaken memory mind intellect the practice celibacy leads boost bodily energy clarity intellect gigantic power retentive memory keen spiritual intellect it creates sparkle eyes luster cheeksthe definition celibacy not restricted mere abstinence physical indulgence the agni purāṇ states eightfold activities related sex must controlled thinking talking joking envisioning desiring wooing get someone interested enticing someone interested engaging for one considered celibate must shunned thus celibacy not requires abstinence sexual intercourse also refrainment masturbation homosexual acts sexual practicesfurther shree krishna states object meditation god alone this point reiterated next verse
6,15,युञ्जन्नेवं सदात्मानं योगी नियतमानस: | शान्तिं निर्वाणपरमां मत्संस्थामधिगच्छति ॥15॥,"Concentrating the mind thus for ever, the yogi of controlled mind achieves the Peace which culminates in Liberation and which abides in Me.","Varieties of techniques for meditation exist in the world. There are Zen techniques, Buddhist techniques, Tantric techniques, Taoist techniques, Vedic techniques, and so on. Each of these has many sub-branches. Amongst the followers of Hinduism itself, there are innumerable techniques being practiced. Which of these should we adopt for our personal practice? Shree Krishna makes this riddle easy to solve. He states that the object of meditation should be God himself and God alone.The aim of meditation is not merely to enhance concentration and focus, but also to purify the mind. Meditating on the breath, chakras, void, flame, etc. is helpful in developing focus. However, the purification of the mind is only possible when we fix it upon an all-pure object, which is God himself. Hence, verse 14.26 states that God is beyond the three modes of material nature, and when one fixes the mind upon him, it too rises above the three modes. Thus, meditating upon the prāṇas may be called transcendental by its practitioners, but true transcendental meditation is upon God alone.Now what is the way of fixing the mind upon God? We can make all of God’s divine attributes—names, forms, virtues, pastimes, abodes, associates—the objects of meditation. They are all non-different from God and replete with all his energies. Hence, devotees may meditate upon any of these and get the true benefit of meditating upon God. In the various bhakti traditions in India, the name of God is made the basis of contemplation. Thus, the Ramayan states:brahma rām teṅ nāmu baṛa, bara dāyaka bara dāni [v10]“God’s name is bigger than God himself, in terms of its utility to the souls.” Taking the name is a very convenient way of remembering God, since it can be taken anywhere and everywhere—while walking, talking, sitting, eating, etc.However, for most sādhaks the name by itself is not sufficiently attractive for enchanting the mind. Due to sanskārs of endless lifetimes, the mind is naturally drawn to forms. Using the form of God as the basis, meditation becomes natural and easy. This is called rūp dhyān meditation.Once the mind is focused upon the form of God, we can then further enhance it by contemplating upon the virtues of God—his compassion, his beauty, his knowledge, his love, his benevolence, his grace, and so on. One can then advance in meditation by serving God in the mind. We can visualize ourselves offering foodstuffs to him, worshipping him, singing to him, massaging him, fanning him, bathing him, cooking for him, etc. This is called mānasī sevā (serving God in the mind). In this way, we can meditate upon the names, forms, virtues, pastimes, etc. of God. All these become powerful means of fulfilling Shree Krishna’s instruction to Arjun, in this verse, to keep the mind absorbed in him.At the end of the verse, Shree Krishna gives the ultimate benefits of meditation, which are liberation from Maya and the everlasting beatitude of God-realization.",varieties techniques meditation exist world there zen techniques buddhist techniques tantric techniques taoist techniques vedic techniques each many subbranches amongst followers hinduism innumerable techniques practiced which adopt personal practice shree krishna makes riddle easy solve he states object meditation god god alonethe aim meditation not merely enhance concentration focus also purify mind meditating breath chakras void flame etc helpful developing focus however purification mind possible fix upon allpure object god hence verse states god beyond three modes material nature one fixes mind upon rises three modes thus meditating upon prāṇas may called transcendental practitioners true transcendental meditation upon god alonenow way fixing mind upon god we make god divine forms virtues pastimes abodes objects meditation they nondifferent god replete energies hence devotees may meditate upon get true benefit meditating upon god in various bhakti traditions india name god made basis contemplation thus ramayan states brahma rām teṅ nāmu baṛa bara dāyaka bara dāni god name bigger god terms utility souls taking name convenient way remembering god since taken anywhere walking talking sitting eating etchowever sādhaks name not sufficiently attractive enchanting mind due sanskārs endless lifetimes mind naturally drawn forms using form god basis meditation becomes natural easy this called rūp dhyān meditationonce mind focused upon form god enhance contemplating upon virtues compassion beauty knowledge love benevolence grace one advance meditation serving god mind we visualize offering foodstuffs worshipping singing massaging fanning bathing cooking etc this called mānasī sevā serving god mind in way meditate upon names forms virtues pastimes etc god all become powerful means fulfilling shree krishna instruction arjun verse keep mind absorbed himat end verse shree krishna gives ultimate benefits meditation liberation maya everlasting beatitude godrealization
6,16,नात्यश्नतस्तु योगोऽस्ति न चैकान्तमनश्नत: | न चाति स्वप्नशीलस्य जाग्रतो नैव चार्जुन ॥16॥,"But, O Arjuna, Yoga is not for one who eats too much, nor for one who does not eat at all; neither for one who habitually sleeps too long, nor surely for one who keeps awake.","After describing the object of meditation and the end-goal achieved by it, Shree Krishna gives some regulations to follow. He states that those who break the rules of bodily maintenance cannot be successful in Yog. Often beginners on the path, with their incomplete wisdom state: “You are the soul and not this body. So simply engage in spiritual activity, forgetting about the maintenance of the body.”However, such a philosophy cannot get one too far. It is true that we are not the body, yet the body is our carrier as long as we live, and we are obliged to take care of it. The Ayurvedic text, Charak Samhitā states: śharīra mādhyaṁ khalu dharma sādhanam [v11] “The body is the vehicle for engaging in religious activity.” If the body becomes unwell, then spiritual pursuits get impeded too. The Ramayan states: tanu binu bhajana veda nahiṅ varanā [v12] “The Vedas do not recommend that we ignore the body, while engaging in spirituality.” In fact, they instruct us to take good care of our body with the help of material science. The Īśhopaniṣhad states:andhaṁ tamaḥ praviśhanti ye ’vidyām upāsatetato bhūya iva te tamo ya u vidyāyām ratāḥ (9)[v13]“Those who cultivate only material science go to hell. But those who cultivate only spiritual science go to an even darker hell.” Material science is necessary for the maintenance of our body, while spiritual science is necessary for the manifestation of the internal divinity within us. We must balance both in our lives to reach the goal of life. Hence, yogāsans, prāṇāyām, and the science of proper diet are an essential part of Vedic knowledge. Each of the four Vedas has its associate Veda for material knowledge. The associate Veda of Atharva Veda is Ayurveda, which is the hoary science of medicine and good health. This demonstrates that the Vedas lay emphasis on the maintenance of physical health. Accordingly, Shree Krishna says that overeating or not eating at all, extreme activity or complete inactivity, etc. are all impediments to Yog. Spiritual practitioners should take good care of their body, by eating fresh nutritious food, doing daily exercise, and getting the right amount of sleep every night.",after describing object meditation endgoal achieved shree krishna gives regulations follow he states break rules bodily maintenance not successful yog often beginners path incomplete wisdom state you soul not body so simply engage spiritual activity forgetting maintenance body however philosophy not get one far it true not body yet body carrier long live obliged take care the ayurvedic text charak samhitā states śharīra mādhyaṁ khalu dharma sādhanam the body vehicle engaging religious activity if body becomes unwell spiritual pursuits get impeded the ramayan states tanu binu bhajana veda nahiṅ varanā the vedas not recommend ignore body engaging spirituality in fact instruct us take good care body help material science the īśhopaniṣhad states andhaṁ tamaḥ praviśhanti ye vidyām upāsatetato bhūya iva te tamo ya u vidyāyām ratāḥ those cultivate material science go hell but cultivate spiritual science go even darker hell material science necessary maintenance body spiritual science necessary manifestation internal divinity within us we must balance lives reach goal life hence yogāsans prāṇāyām science proper diet essential part vedic knowledge each four vedas associate veda material knowledge the associate veda atharva veda ayurveda hoary science medicine good health this demonstrates vedas lay emphasis maintenance physical health accordingly shree krishna says overeating not eating extreme activity complete inactivity etc impediments yog spiritual practitioners take good care body eating fresh nutritious food daily exercise getting right amount sleep every night

The opposite of Yog is bhog, which means engagement in sensual pleasures. Indulgence in bhog violates the natural laws of the body, and results in rog (disease). As stated in the previous verse, if the body becomes diseased, it impedes the practice of Yog. Thus in this verse, Shree Krishna states that by being temperate in bodily activities and practicing Yog, we can become free from the sorrows of the body and mind.The same instruction was repeated two-and-a-half millennium after Shree Krishna by Gautam Buddha, when he recommended the golden middle path between severe asceticism and sensual indulgence. There is a beautiful story regarding this. It is said that before gaining enlightenment, Gautam Buddha once gave up eating and drinking, and sat in meditation. However, after a few days of practicing in this manner, the lack of nourishment made him weak and dizzy, and he found it impossible to steady his mind in meditation. At that time, some village women happened to be passing by. They were carrying water pots on their heads that they had filled from the river nearby, and were singing a song. The words of the song were: “Tighten the strings of the tānpurā (a stringed Indian musical instrument, resembling a guitar). But do not tighten them so much that the strings break.” Their words entered the ears of Gautam Buddha, and he exclaimed, “These illiterate village women are singing such words of wisdom. They contain a message for us humans. We too should tighten our bodies (practice austerities), but not to the extent that the body is destroyed.”Benjamin Franklin (1706 – 1790), a founding father of the United States, is highly regarded as a self-made man. In an effort to grow his character, starting at the age of 20, he maintained a diary in which he tracked his performance related to the 13 activities he wanted to grow in. The first activity was “Temperance: Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.”",yog union soul god the opposite yog bhog means engagement sensual pleasures indulgence bhog violates natural laws body results rog disease as stated previous verse body becomes diseased impedes practice yog thus verse shree krishna states temperate bodily activities practicing yog become free sorrows body mindthe instruction repeated twoandahalf millennium shree krishna gautam buddha recommended golden middle path severe asceticism sensual indulgence there beautiful story regarding it said gaining enlightenment gautam buddha gave eating drinking sat meditation however days practicing manner lack nourishment made weak dizzy found impossible steady mind meditation at time village women happened passing they carrying water pots heads filled river nearby singing song the words song tighten strings tānpurā stringed indian musical instrument resembling guitar but not tighten much strings break their words entered ears gautam buddha exclaimed these illiterate village women singing words wisdom they contain message us humans we tighten bodies practice austerities not extent body destroyed benjamin franklin founding father united states highly regarded selfmade man in effort grow character starting age maintained diary tracked performance related activities wanted grow the first activity temperance eat not dullness drink not elevation

The answer is when the controlled chitta (mind) becomes fixed and focused exclusively on God. It is then simultaneously and automatically weaned away from all cravings of the senses and desires for worldly enjoyment. At that time one can be considered as yukt, or having perfect Yog. At the end of this very chapter, he also states: “Of all yogis, those whose minds are always absorbed in me, and who engage in devotion to me with great faith, them I consider to be the highest of all.” (Verse 6.47)",when person complete practice yog the answer controlled chitta mind becomes fixed focused exclusively god it simultaneously automatically weaned away cravings senses desires worldly enjoyment at time one considered yukt perfect yog at end chapter also states of yogis whose minds always absorbed engage devotion great faith i consider highest all verse

In the wind, the flame flickers naturally and is impossible to control. However, in a windless place, the flame becomes as steady as a picture. Similarly, the mind is fickle by nature and very difficult to control. But when the mind of a yogi is in enthralled union with God, it becomes sheltered against the winds of desire.

However, if we put alum in the water, the mud settles down and the water becomes clear. Similarly, when the mind is unclean, it obscures perception of the soul and any acquired scriptural knowledge of the ātmā is only at the theoretical level. But when the mind becomes pure, the soul is directly perceived through realization.",having presented process meditation state perfection shree krishna reveals results endeavors when mind purified one able perceive self distinct body mind intellect for example muddy water glass not see however put alum water mud settles water becomes clear similarly mind unclean obscures perception soul acquired scriptural knowledge ātmā theoretical level but mind becomes pure soul directly perceived realization

It stems from the fact that we are tiny parts of God, who is an ocean of bliss. A number of quotations from the Vedic scriptures establishing this were mentioned in verse 5.21. Here are some more quotations expressing the nature of God as having an infinite ocean of bliss:raso vai saḥ rasaṁ hyevāyaṁ labdhvā nandī bhavati  (Taittirīya Upaniṣhad 2.7)[v14]“God is bliss himself; the individual soul becomes blissful on attaining him.”ānandamayo ’bhyāsāt (Brahma Sūtra 1.1.12)[v15]“God is the veritable form of bliss.”satya jñānānantānanda mātraika rasa mūrtayaḥ  (Bhāgavatam 10.13.54)[v16]“The divine form of God is made of eternity, knowledge, and bliss.”ānanda sindhu madhya tava vāsā, binu jāne kata marasi piyāsā (Ramayan)[v17]“God, who is the ocean of bliss, is seated within you. Without knowing him, how can your thirst for happiness be satiated?”We have been seeking perfect bliss for eons, and everything we do is in search of that bliss. However, from the objects of gratification, the mind and senses perceive only a shadowy reflection of true bliss. This sensual gratification fails to satisfy the longing of the soul within, which yearns for the infinite bliss of God.When the mind is in union with God, the soul experiences the ineffable and sublime bliss beyond the scope of the senses. This state is called samādhi in the Vedic scriptures. The Sage Patanjali states: samādhisiddhirīśhvara praṇidhānāt  (Patañjali Yog Darśhan 2.45)[v18] “For success in samādhi, surrender to the Supreme Lord.” In the state of samādhi, experiencing complete satisfaction and contentment, the soul has nothing left to desire, and thus becomes firmly situated in the Absolute Truth, without deviating from it for even a moment.",the yearning bliss intrinsic nature soul it stems fact tiny parts god ocean bliss a number quotations vedic scriptures establishing mentioned verse here quotations expressing nature god infinite ocean bliss raso vai saḥ rasaṁ hyevāyaṁ labdhvā nandī bhavati taittirīya upaniṣhad god bliss individual soul becomes blissful attaining him ānandamayo bhyāsāt brahma sūtra god veritable form bliss satya jñānānantānanda mātraika rasa mūrtayaḥ bhāgavatam the divine form god made eternity knowledge bliss ānanda sindhu madhya tava vāsā binu jāne kata marasi piyāsā ramayan god ocean bliss seated within without knowing thirst happiness satiated we seeking perfect bliss eons everything search bliss however objects gratification mind senses perceive shadowy reflection true bliss this sensual gratification fails satisfy longing soul within yearns infinite bliss godwhen mind union god soul experiences ineffable sublime bliss beyond scope senses this state called samādhi vedic scriptures the sage patanjali states samādhisiddhirīśhvara praṇidhānāt patañjali yog darśhan for success samādhi surrender supreme lord in state samādhi experiencing complete satisfaction contentment soul nothing left desire thus becomes firmly situated absolute truth without deviating even moment
6,22,यं लब्ध्वा चापरं लाभं मन्यते नाधिकं तत: | यस्मिन्स्थितो न दु:खेन गुरुणापि विचाल्यते ॥22॥,"Obtaining which one does not think of any other acquisition to be superior to that, and being established in which one is not perturbed even by great sorrow;","In the material realm, no extent of attainment satiates a person totally. A poor person strives hard to become rich, and feels satisfied if he or she is able to become a millionaire. But when that same millionaire looks at a billionaire, discontentment sets in again. The billionaire is also discontented by looking at an even richer person. No matter what happiness we get, when we perceive a higher state of happiness, the feeling of unfulfillment lingers. But happiness achieved from the state of Yog is the infinite bliss of God. Since there is nothing higher than that, on experiencing that infinite bliss, the soul naturally perceives that it has reached its goal.God’s divine bliss is also eternal, and it can never be snatched away from the yogi who has attained it once. Such a God-realized soul, though residing in the material body, remains in the state of divine consciousness. Sometimes, externally, it seems that the Saint is facing tribulations in the form of illness, antagonistic people, and oppressive environment, but internally the Saint retains divine consciousness and continues to relish the bliss of God. Thus, even the biggest difficulty cannot shake such a Saint. Established in union with God, the Saint rises above bodily consciousness and is thus not affected by bodily harm. Accordingly, we hear from the Puranas how Prahlad was put in a pit of snakes, tortured with weapons, placed in the fire, thrown off a cliff, etc. but none of these difficulties could break Prahlad’s devotional union with God.",in material realm extent attainment satiates person totally a poor person strives hard become rich feels satisfied able become millionaire but millionaire looks billionaire discontentment sets the billionaire also discontented looking even richer person no matter happiness get perceive higher state happiness feeling unfulfillment lingers but happiness achieved state yog infinite bliss god since nothing higher experiencing infinite bliss soul naturally perceives reached goalgod divine bliss also eternal never snatched away yogi attained such godrealized soul though residing material body remains state divine consciousness sometimes externally seems saint facing tribulations form illness antagonistic people oppressive environment internally saint retains divine consciousness continues relish bliss god thus even biggest difficulty not shake saint established union god saint rises bodily consciousness thus not affected bodily harm accordingly hear puranas prahlad put pit snakes tortured weapons placed fire thrown cliff etc none difficulties could break prahlad devotional union god

That Yoga has to be practised with perseverance and with an undepressed heart.,"The material world is the realm of Maya, and it has been termed by Shree Krishna in verse 8.15 as duḥkhālayam aśhāśhvatam, or temporary and full of misery. Thus, the material energy Maya is compared to darkness. It has put us in the darkness of ignorance and is making us suffer in the world. However, the darkness of Maya naturally gets dispelled when we bring the light of God into our heart. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu states this very beautifully:kṛiṣhṇa sūrya-sama, māyā haya andhakāra yāhāñ kṛiṣhṇa, tāhāñ nāhi māyāra adhikāra(Chaitanya Charitāmṛit, Madhya Leela, 22.31)[v19]“God is like the light and Maya is like darkness. Just as darkness does not have the power to engulf light, similarly Maya can never overcome God.” Now, the nature of God is divine bliss while the consequence of Maya is misery. Thus, one who attains the divine bliss of God can never be overcome by the misery of Maya again.Thus, the state of Yog implies both 1) attainment of bliss, and 2) freedom from misery. Shree Krishna emphasizes both successively. In the previous verse, the attainment of bliss was highlighted as the result of Yog; in this verse, freedom from misery is being emphasized.In the second line of this verse Shree Krishna states that the stage of perfection has to be reached through determined practice. He then goes on to explain how we must practice meditation.",the material world realm maya termed shree krishna verse duḥkhālayam aśhāśhvatam temporary full misery thus material energy maya compared darkness it put us darkness ignorance making us suffer world however darkness maya naturally gets dispelled bring light god heart chaitanya mahaprabhu states beautifully kṛiṣhṇa sūryasama māyā haya andhakāra yāhāñ kṛiṣhṇa tāhāñ nāhi māyāra adhikāra chaitanya charitāmṛit madhya leela god like light maya like darkness just darkness not power engulf light similarly maya never overcome god now nature god divine bliss consequence maya misery thus one attains divine bliss god never overcome misery maya againthus state yog implies attainment bliss freedom misery shree krishna emphasizes successively in previous verse attainment bliss highlighted result yog verse freedom misery emphasizedin second line verse shree krishna states stage perfection reached determined practice he goes explain must practice meditation

Here, Shree Krishna begins by describing the first part of the process—taking the mind away from the world.Thoughts of worldly things, people, events, etc. come to the mind when it is attached to the world. Initially, the thoughts are in the form of sphurṇā (flashes of feelings and ideas). When we insist on the implementation of sphurṇā, it becomes saṅkalp. Thus, thoughts lead to saṅkalp (pursuit of these objects) and vikalp (revulsion from them), depending upon whether the attachment is positive or negative. The seed of pursuit and revulsion grows into the plant of desire, “This should happen. This should not happen.” Both saṅkalp and vikalp immediately create impressions on the mind, like the film of a camera exposed to the light. Thus, they directly impede meditation upon God. They also have a natural tendency to flare up, and a desire that is a seed today can become an inferno tomorrow. Thus, one who desires success in meditation should renounce the affinity for material objects.Having described the first part of the process of meditation—removing the mind from the world—Shree Krishna then talks of the second part. The mind should be made to reside upon God. He says this will not happen automatically, but with determined effort, success will come slowly.Determination of resolve that is in accordance with the scriptures is called dhṛiti. This determination comes with conviction of the intellect. Many people acquire academic knowledge of the scriptures about the nature of the self and the futility of worldly pursuits. But their daily life is at variance with their knowledge, and they are seen to indulge in sin, sex, and intoxication. This happens because their intellect is not convinced about that knowledge. The power of discrimination comes with the conviction of the intellect about the impermanence of the world and the eternality of one’s relationship with God. Thus utilizing the intellect, one must gradually cease sensual indulgence. This is called pratyāhār, or control of the mind and senses from running toward the objects of the senses. Success in pratyāhār will not come immediately. It will be achieved through gradual and repeated exercise. Shree Krishna explains next what that exercise involves.",meditation requires dual process removing mind world fixing god here shree krishna begins describing first part mind away worldthoughts worldly things people events etc come mind attached world initially thoughts form sphurṇā flashes feelings ideas when insist implementation sphurṇā becomes saṅkalp thus thoughts lead saṅkalp pursuit objects vikalp revulsion depending upon whether attachment positive negative the seed pursuit revulsion grows plant desire this happen this not happen both saṅkalp vikalp immediately create impressions mind like film camera exposed light thus directly impede meditation upon god they also natural tendency flare desire seed today become inferno tomorrow thus one desires success meditation renounce affinity material objectshaving described first part process mind krishna talks second part the mind made reside upon god he says not happen automatically determined effort success come slowlydetermination resolve accordance scriptures called dhṛiti this determination comes conviction intellect many people acquire academic knowledge scriptures nature self futility worldly pursuits but daily life variance knowledge seen indulge sin sex intoxication this happens intellect not convinced knowledge the power discrimination comes conviction intellect impermanence world eternality one relationship god thus utilizing intellect one must gradually cease sensual indulgence this called pratyāhār control mind senses running toward objects senses success pratyāhār not come immediately it achieved gradual repeated exercise shree krishna explains next exercise involves

They also have a natural tendency to flare up, and a desire that is a seed today can become an inferno tomorrow. Thus, one who desires success in meditation should renounce the affinity for material objects.Having described the first part of the process of meditation—removing the mind from the world—Shree Krishna then talks of the second part. The mind should be made to reside upon God. He says this will not happen automatically, but with determined effort, success will come slowly.Determination of resolve that is in accordance with the scriptures is called dhṛiti. This determination comes with conviction of the intellect. Many people acquire academic knowledge of the scriptures about the nature of the self and the futility of worldly pursuits. But their daily life is at variance with their knowledge, and they are seen to indulge in sin, sex, and intoxication. This happens because their intellect is not convinced about that knowledge. The power of discrimination comes with the conviction of the intellect about the impermanence of the world and the eternality of one’s relationship with God. Thus utilizing the intellect, one must gradually cease sensual indulgence. This is called pratyāhār, or control of the mind and senses from running toward the objects of the senses. Success in pratyāhār will not come immediately. It will be achieved through gradual and repeated exercise. Shree Krishna explains next what that exercise involves.",meditation requires dual process removing mind world fixing god here shree krishna begins describing first part mind away worldthoughts worldly things people events etc come mind attached world initially thoughts form sphurṇā flashes feelings ideas when insist implementation sphurṇā becomes saṅkalp thus thoughts lead saṅkalp pursuit objects vikalp revulsion depending upon whether attachment positive negative the seed pursuit revulsion grows plant desire this happen this not happen both saṅkalp vikalp immediately create impressions mind like film camera exposed light thus directly impede meditation upon god they also natural tendency flare desire seed today become inferno tomorrow thus one desires success meditation renounce affinity material objectshaving described first part process mind krishna talks second part the mind made reside upon god he says not happen automatically determined effort success come slowlydetermination resolve accordance scriptures called dhṛiti this determination comes conviction intellect many people acquire academic knowledge scriptures nature self futility worldly pursuits but daily life variance knowledge seen indulge sin sex intoxication this happens intellect not convinced knowledge the power discrimination comes conviction intellect impermanence world eternality one relationship god thus utilizing intellect one must gradually cease sensual indulgence this called pratyāhār control mind senses running toward objects senses success pratyāhār not come immediately it achieved gradual repeated exercise shree krishna explains next exercise involves
6,26,यतो यतो निश्चरति मनश्चञ्चलमस्थिरम् | ततस्ततो नियम्यैतदात्मन्येव वशं नयेत् ॥26॥,"(The yogi) should bring (this mind) under the subjugation of the Self Itself, by restraining it from all those causes whatever due to which the restless, unsteady mind wanders away.","Success in meditation is not achieved in a day; the path to perfection is long and arduous. When we sit for meditation with the resolve to focus our mind upon God, we will find that ever so often it wanders off in worldly saṅkalp and vikalp. It is thus important to understand the three steps involved in the process of meditation:With the intellect’s power of discrimination we decide that the world is not our goal. Hence, we forcefully remove the mind from the world. This requires effort.Again, with the power of discrimination we understand that God alone is ours, and God-realization is our goal. Hence, we bring the mind to focus upon God. This also requires effort.The mind comes away from God, and wanders back into the world. This does not require effort, it happens automatically.When the third step happens by itself, sādhaks often become disappointed, “I tried so hard to focus upon God, but the mind went back into the world.” Shree Krishna asks us not to feel disappointed. He says the mind is fickle and we should be prepared that it will wander off in the direction of its infatuation, despite our best efforts to control it. However, when it does wander off, we should once again repeat steps 1 and 2—take the mind away from the world and bring it back to God. Once again, we will experience that step 3 takes place by itself. We should not lose heart, and again repeat steps 1 and 2.We will have to do this repeatedly. Then slowly, the mind’s attachment toward God will start increasing. And simultaneously, its detachment from the world will also increase. As this happens, it will become easier and easier to meditate. But in the beginning, we must be prepared for the battle involved in disciplining the mind.",success meditation not achieved day path perfection long arduous when sit meditation resolve focus mind upon god find ever often wanders worldly saṅkalp vikalp it thus important understand three steps involved process meditation with intellect power discrimination decide world not goal hence forcefully remove mind world this requires effortagain power discrimination understand god alone godrealization goal hence bring mind focus upon god this also requires effortthe mind comes away god wanders back world this not require effort happens automaticallywhen third step happens sādhaks often become disappointed i tried hard focus upon god mind went back world shree krishna asks us not feel disappointed he says mind fickle prepared wander direction infatuation despite best efforts control however wander repeat steps mind away world bring back god once experience step takes place we not lose heart repeat steps repeatedly then slowly mind attachment toward god start increasing and simultaneously detachment world also increase as happens become easier easier meditate but beginning must prepared battle involved disciplining mind
6,27,प्रशान्तमनसं ह्येनं योगिनं सुखमुत्तमम् | उपैति शान्तरजसं ब्रह्मभूतमकल्मषम् ॥27॥,"Supreme Bliss comes to this yogi alone whose mind has become perfectly tranquil, whose (quality of) rajas has been eliminated, who has become identified with Brahman, and is taintless.","As a yogi perfects the practice of withdrawing the mind from sense objects and securing it upon God, the passions get subdued and the mind becomes utterly serene. Earlier, effort was required to focus it upon God, but now it naturally runs to him. At this stage, the elevated meditator sees everything in its connection with God. Sage Narad states:tat prāpya tad evāvalokayati, tad eva śhṛiṇoti,tad eva bhāṣhayati, tad eva chintayati(Nārad Bhakti Darśhan, Sūtra 55)[v20]“The consciousness of the devotee whose mind is united in love with God is always absorbed in him. Such a devotee always sees him, hears him, speaks of him, and thinks of him.” When the mind gets absorbed in God in this manner, the soul begins to experience a glimpse of the infinite bliss of God who is seated within.Sādhaks often ask how they can know that they are progressing. The answer is embedded in this verse. When we find our inner transcendental bliss increasing, we can consider it as a symptom that our mind is coming under control and the consciousness is getting spiritually elevated. Here, Shree Krishna says that when we are śhānta-rajasaṁ (free from passion) and akalmaṣham (sinless), then we will become brahma-bhūtam (endowed with God-realization). At that stage, we will experience sukham uttamam (the highest bliss).",as yogi perfects practice withdrawing mind sense objects securing upon god passions get subdued mind becomes utterly serene earlier effort required focus upon god naturally runs at stage elevated meditator sees everything connection god sage narad states tat prāpya tad evāvalokayati tad eva śhṛiṇoti tad eva bhāṣhayati tad eva chintayati nārad bhakti darśhan sūtra the consciousness devotee whose mind united love god always absorbed such devotee always sees hears speaks thinks him when mind gets absorbed god manner soul begins experience glimpse infinite bliss god seated withinsādhaks often ask know progressing the answer embedded verse when find inner transcendental bliss increasing consider symptom mind coming control consciousness getting spiritually elevated here shree krishna says śhāntarajasaṁ free passion akalmaṣham sinless become brahmabhūtam endowed godrealization at stage experience sukham uttamam highest bliss

The easy way to unite the mind with God is to learn to see everything in its connection with him. For example, let us say that someone hurts us. It is the nature of the mind to develop sentiments of resentment, hatred, etc. toward anyone who harms us. However, if we permit that to happen, then our mind comes away from the divine realm, and the devotional union of our mind with God ceases. Instead, if we see the Supreme Lord seated in that person, we will think, “God is testing me through this person. He wants me to increase the virtue of tolerance, and that is why he is inspiring this person to behave badly with me. But I will not permit the incident to disturb me.” Thinking in this way, we will be able to prevent the mind from becoming a victim of negative sentiments.Similarly, the mind separates from God when it gets attached to a friend or relative. Now, if we train the mind to see God in that person, then each time the mind wanders toward him or her, we will think, “Shree Krishna is seated in this person, and thus I am feeling this attraction.” In this manner, the mind will continue to retain its devotional absorption in the Supreme.Sometimes, the mind laments over past incidents. This again separates the mind from the divine realm because lamentation takes the mind into the past and the present contemplation of God and Guru ceases. Now if we see that incident in connection with God, we will think, “The Lord deliberately arranged for me to experience tribulation in the world, so that I may develop detachment. He is so concerned about my welfare that he mercifully arranges for the proper circumstances that are beneficial for my spiritual progress.” By thinking thus, we will be able to protect our devotional focus. Sage Narad states:loka hānau chintā na kāryā niveditātma loka vedatvāt (Nārad Bhakti Darshan, Sūtra 61)[v23]“When you suffer a reversal in the world, do not lament or brood over it. See the grace of God in that incident.” Our self-interest lies in somehow or the other keeping the mind in God, and the simple trick to accomplish this is to see God in everything and everyone. That is the practice stage, which slowly leads to the perfection that is mentioned in this verse, where we are never lost to God and he is never lost to us.",to lose god means let mind wander away means unite mind the easy way unite mind god learn see everything connection for example let us say someone hurts us it nature mind develop sentiments resentment hatred etc toward anyone harms us however permit happen mind comes away divine realm devotional union mind god ceases instead see supreme lord seated person think god testing person he wants increase virtue tolerance inspiring person behave badly but i not permit incident disturb me thinking way able prevent mind becoming victim negative sentimentssimilarly mind separates god gets attached friend relative now train mind see god person time mind wanders toward think shree krishna seated person thus i feeling attraction in manner mind continue retain devotional absorption supremesometimes mind laments past incidents this separates mind divine realm lamentation takes mind past present contemplation god guru ceases now see incident connection god think the lord deliberately arranged experience tribulation world i may develop detachment he concerned welfare mercifully arranges proper circumstances beneficial spiritual progress by thinking thus able protect devotional focus sage narad states loka hānau chintā na kāryā niveditātma loka vedatvāt nārad bhakti darshan sūtra when suffer reversal world not lament brood see grace god incident our selfinterest lies somehow keeping mind god simple trick accomplish see god everything everyone that practice stage slowly leads perfection mentioned verse never lost god never lost us

He is also seated in everyone’s heart as the Supreme Soul. In verse 18.61, Shree Krishna states: “I dwell in the hearts of all living beings.” Thus, within the body of each living being, there are two personalities—the soul and the Supreme Soul.Those in material consciousness see everyone as the body, and make distinctions on the basis of caste, creed, sex, age, social status, etc.Those in superior consciousness see everyone as the soul. Thus in verse 5.18, Shree Krishna states: “The truly learned, with the eyes of divine knowledge, see with equal vision a Brahmin, a cow, an elephant, a dog, and a dog-eater.”The elevated yogis in even higher consciousness see God seated as the Supreme Soul in everyone. They also perceive the world, but they are unconcerned about it. They are like the hansas, the swans who can drink the milk and leave out the water from a mixture of milk and water.The most elevated yogis are called paramahansas. They only see God, and have no perception of the world. This was the level of realization of Shukadev, the son of Ved Vyas, as stated in the Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam:yaṁ pravrajantam anupetam apeta kṛityaṁdvaipāyano viraha-kātara ājuhāvaputreti tan-mayatayā taravo ’bhinedustaṁ sarva-bhūta-hṛidayaṁ munim ānato ’smi(1.2.2)[v24]When Shukadev entered the renounced order of sanyās, walking away from home in his childhood itself, he was at such an elevated level that he had no perception of the world. He did not even notice the beautiful women bathing in the nude in a lake, while he happened to pass by there. All that he perceived was God; all that he heard was God; all that he thought was God.In this verse, Shree Krishna is talking about the perfected yogis who are in the third and fourth stages of the above levels of realization.",god allpervading world he also seated everyone heart supreme soul in verse shree krishna states i dwell hearts living beings thus within body living two soul supreme soulthose material consciousness see everyone body make distinctions basis caste creed sex age social status etcthose superior consciousness see everyone soul thus verse shree krishna states the truly learned eyes divine knowledge see equal vision brahmin cow elephant dog dogeater the elevated yogis even higher consciousness see god seated supreme soul everyone they also perceive world unconcerned they like hansas swans drink milk leave water mixture milk waterthe elevated yogis called paramahansas they see god perception world this level realization shukadev son ved vyas stated śhrīmad bhāgavatam yaṁ pravrajantam anupetam apeta kṛityaṁdvaipāyano virahakātara ājuhāvaputreti tanmayatayā taravo bhinedustaṁ sarvabhūtahṛidayaṁ munim ānato smi when shukadev entered renounced order sanyās walking away home childhood elevated level perception world he not even notice beautiful women bathing nude lake happened pass all perceived god heard god thought godin verse shree krishna talking perfected yogis third fourth stages levels realization

6,34,चञ्चलं हि मन: कृष्ण प्रमाथि बलवद्दृढम् | तस्याहं निग्रहं मन्ये वायोरिव सुदुष्करम् ॥34॥,"For, O Krsna, the mind is unsteady, turbulent, strong and obstinate. I consider its control to be as greatly difficult as of the wind.","Arjun speaks for us all when he describes the troublesome mind. It is restless because it keeps flitting in different directions, from subject to subject. It is turbulent because it creates upheavals in one’s consciousness, in the form of hatred, anger, lust, greed, envy, anxiety, fear, attachment, etc. It is strong because it overpowers the intellect with its vigorous currents and destroys the faculty of discrimination. The mind is also obstinate because when it catches a harmful thought, it refuses to let go, and continues to ruminate over it again and again, even to the dismay of the intellect. Thus enumerating its unwholesome characteristics, Arjun declares that the mind is even more difficult to control than the wind. It is a powerful analogy for no one can ever think of controlling the mighty wind in the sky.In this verse, Arjun has addressed the Lord as Krishna. The word “Krishna” means: karṣhati yogināṁ paramahansānāṁ chetānsi iti kṛiṣhṇaḥ [v25] “Krishna is he who forcefully attracts the minds of even the most powerfully-minded yogis and paramahansas.” Arjun is thus indicating that Krishna should also attract his restless, turbulent, strong, and obstinate mind.",arjun speaks us describes troublesome mind it restless keeps flitting different directions subject subject it turbulent creates upheavals one consciousness form hatred anger lust greed envy anxiety fear attachment etc it strong overpowers intellect vigorous currents destroys faculty discrimination the mind also obstinate catches harmful thought refuses let go continues ruminate even dismay intellect thus enumerating unwholesome characteristics arjun declares mind even difficult control wind it powerful analogy one ever think controlling mighty wind skyin verse arjun addressed lord krishna the word krishna means karṣhati yogināṁ paramahansānāṁ chetānsi iti kṛiṣhṇaḥ krishna forcefully attracts minds even powerfullyminded yogis paramahansas arjun thus indicating krishna also attract restless turbulent strong obstinate mind
6,35,श्रीभगवानुवाच | असंशयं महाबाहो मनो दुर्निग्रहं चलम् | अभ्यासेन तु कौन्तेय वैराग्येण च गृह्यते ॥35॥,"The Blessed Lord said: O mighty-armed one, undoubtedly the mind is intractable and restless. But, O son of Kunti, it is brought under control through practice and detachment.","Shree Krishna responds to Arjun’s comment by calling him Mahābāho, which means “Mighty armed one.” He implies, “O Arjun, you defeated the bravest warriors in battle. Can you not defeat the mind?”Shree Krishna does not deny the problem, by saying, “Arjun, what nonsense are you speaking? The mind can be controlled very easily.” Rather, he agrees with Arjun’s statement that the mind is indeed difficult to control. However, so many things are difficult to achieve in the world and yet we remain undaunted and move forward. For example, sailors know that the sea is dangerous and the possibility of terrible storms exists. Yet, they have never found those dangers as sufficient reasons for remaining ashore. Hence, Shree Krishna assures Arjun that the mind can be controlled by vairāgya and abhyās.Vairāgya means detachment. We observe that the mind runs toward the objects of its attachment, toward the direction it has been habituated to running in the past. The elimination of attachment eradicates the unnecessary wanderings of the mind.Abhyās means practice, or a concerted and persistent effort to change an old habit or develop a new one. Practice is a very important word for sādhaks. In all fields of human endeavor, practice is the key that opens the door to mastery and excellence. Take, for example, a mundane activity such as typing. The first time people begin typing, they are able to type one word in a minute. But after a year’s typing, their fingers fly on the keyboard at the speed of eighty words a minute. This proficiency comes solely through practice. Similarly, the obstinate and turbulent mind has to be made to rest on the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord through abhyās. Take the mind away from the world—this is vairāgya—and bring the mind to rest on God—this is abhyās. Sage Patanjali gives the same instruction:abhyāsa vairāgyābhyāṁ tannirodhaḥ  (Yog Darśhan 1.12)[v26]“The perturbations of the mind can be controlled by constant practice and detachment.”",shree krishna responds arjun comment calling mahābāho means mighty armed one he implies o arjun defeated bravest warriors battle can not defeat mind shree krishna not deny problem saying arjun nonsense speaking the mind controlled easily rather agrees arjun statement mind indeed difficult control however many things difficult achieve world yet remain undaunted move forward for example sailors know sea dangerous possibility terrible storms exists yet never found dangers sufficient reasons remaining ashore hence shree krishna assures arjun mind controlled vairāgya abhyāsvairāgya means detachment we observe mind runs toward objects attachment toward direction habituated running past the elimination attachment eradicates unnecessary wanderings mindabhyās means practice concerted persistent effort change old habit develop new one practice important word sādhaks in fields human endeavor practice key opens door mastery excellence take example mundane activity typing the first time people begin typing able type one word minute but year typing fingers fly keyboard speed eighty words minute this proficiency comes solely practice similarly obstinate turbulent mind made rest lotus feet supreme lord abhyās take mind away bring mind rest abhyās sage patanjali gives instruction abhyāsa vairāgyābhyāṁ tannirodhaḥ yog darśhan the perturbations mind controlled constant practice detachment

He says that those who have not learnt to bridle the mind through abhyās and vairāgya find great difficulty in the practice of Yog. But those who have brought the mind under their control through persistent effort can achieve success by adopting the proper means. The perfect process has already been described by him from verses 6.10 to 6.32. It includes subduing the senses, giving up all desires, focusing the mind upon God alone, thinking of him with an unwavering mind, and seeing everyone with equal vision.This statement creates a doubt in Arjun’s mind regarding the sādhak who is unable to control the mind, and he now questions Shree Krishna in this regard.",the supreme divine personality shree krishna gives link control mind success yog he says not learnt bridle mind abhyās vairāgya find great difficulty practice yog but brought mind control persistent effort achieve success adopting proper means the perfect process already described verses it includes subduing senses giving desires focusing mind upon god alone thinking unwavering mind seeing everyone equal visionthis statement creates doubt arjun mind regarding sādhak unable control mind questions shree krishna regard

Those who consider the world to be a source of happiness strive for material advancement. And those who consider spiritual wealth to be the real treasure worthy of possessing, strive for it by rejecting material endeavors. However, if such spiritualists fail in their attempt, they are apparently left with neither spiritual nor material assets. Thinking in this manner, Arjun asks whether their position is like that of a broken cloud. A cloud, which breaks away from the group of clouds, becomes worthless. It neither offers sufficient shade, nor does it increase its weight and become rain-bearing. It merely blows in the wind and perishes like a non-entity in the sky.

Such realized Saints do possess the power to dispel doubts, but they cannot compete with God, who is all-knowing.

Here, by displaying his affection and grace toward Arjun, Shree Krishna wishes to indicate that God takes care of those who tread on his path.

One falls from Yog because of the desire for bhog. So God, like an indulgent father, gives that fallen yogi a chance to engage in bhog in the next life and realize that it is an exercise in futility, which does not satiate the yearning of the soul for permanent bliss.

That is how in history, great princes, noblemen, wealthy businesspersons, etc. renounced the comfort of their worldly position to become ascetics, yogis, sages, mystics, and swamis.

Shree Krishna declares the bhakti yogi to be the highest, superior to even the best aṣhṭāṅg yogi and haṭha yogi. That is because bhakti , or devotion, is the highest power of God. It is such a power that binds God and makes him a slave of his devotee. Thus, he states in the Bhāgavatam:ahaṁ bhakta-parādhīno hyasvatantra iva dvijasādhubhir grasta-hṛidayo bhaktair bhakta-jana-priyaḥ (9.4.63)[v27]“Although I am supremely independent, yet I become enslaved by my devotees. They conquer my heart. What to speak of my devotees, even the devotees of my devotees are very dear to me.” The bhakti yogi possesses the power of divine love, and is thus most dear to God and considered by him to be the highest of all.In this verse, Shree Krishna has used the word bhajate. It comes from the root word bhaj, which means “to serve.” It is a far more significant word for devotion than “worship,” which means “to adore.” Here, Shree Krishna is talking about those who, not merely adore him, but also serve him with loving devotion. They are thus established in the natural position of the soul as the servant of God, while the other kinds of yogis are still incomplete in their realization. They have connected themselves with God, but they have not yet situated themselves in the understanding that they are his eternal servants.muktānām api siddhānāṁ nārāyaṇa-parāyaṇaḥsu-durlabhaḥ praśhāntātmā koṭiṣhv api mahā-mune (Bhāgavatam 6.14.5)[v28]“Amongst many millions of perfected and liberated saints, the peaceful person who is devoted to the Supreme Lord, Narayan, is very rare.”Another way of understanding this verse is that bhakti yog provides the closest and most complete realization of God.

This gives rise to a few questions, such as, how can one get to know the Supreme Lord? How should a devotee worship Him and meditate upon Him?Although Arjun had not asked these questions, yet the Omniscient and kind Lord began to answer. Here, Shree Krishna has used the terms mad-āśhrayaḥ, meaning “with your mind focused on Me” and śhṛiṇu, which means “listen.” He is asking Arjun to listen to Him attentively.",while concluding previous chapter shree krishna stated best yogis exclusively focus god serve him great dedication this gives rise questions one get know supreme lord how devotee worship him meditate upon him although arjun not asked questions yet omniscient kind lord began answer here shree krishna used terms madāśhrayaḥ meaning mind focused me śhṛiṇu means listen he asking arjun listen him attentively

In contrast, vijñāna (wisdom) is the knowledge gained through spiritual practice, it is a direct experiential realization; and should not be misunderstood for intellectual knowledge. An example to explain this is honey kept in a sealed jar. We have heard that honey has the sweetest taste that is incomparable to any other sweet. But unless we open the jar and taste it, we will not get the experiential realization of its sweetness.Likewise, the Guru gives us jñāna, which is the theoretical knowledge of the scriptures. Yet, we need to practice sadhana as per the acquired jñāna, which would consequently purify our mind. Only then, vijñāna (wisdom) knowledge, through self-realization will be attained.Once Sage Ved Vyas intended to write the Shreemad Bhagavatam: a scripture that would describe God, His glories, nature, and as the object of devotion. But he did not wish to write it only based upon his jñāna. Therefore, first he engaged himself  in bhakti to attain the experiential realization, which is vijñāna. He wrote:bhakti-yogena manasi samyak praṇihite ’male apaśhyat puruṣhaṁ pūrvaṁ māyāṁ cha tad-apāśhrayām(Bhagavatam 1.7.4)“Through bhakti-yog, Ved Vyas fixed his mind upon God without any material sentiments, and thus attained the complete vision and realization of the Supreme Divine Personality along with His external energy, Maya, which was under His control.”  Inspired by this realization, he wrote the epic scripture.In this verse, Lord Shree Krishna affirms to Arjun that He will bestow upon him the theoretical knowledge regarding the Supreme Divine Personality. He will also illuminate his mind with the required wisdom. Once this knowledge is acquired, there will be nothing remaining for him to know.",jñāna knowledge learned applying mind senses intellect in contrast vijñāna wisdom knowledge gained spiritual practice direct experiential realization not misunderstood intellectual knowledge an example explain honey kept sealed jar we heard honey sweetest taste incomparable sweet but unless open jar taste not get experiential realization sweetnesslikewise guru gives us jñāna theoretical knowledge scriptures yet need practice sadhana per acquired jñāna would consequently purify mind only vijñāna wisdom knowledge selfrealization attainedonce sage ved vyas intended write shreemad bhagavatam scripture would describe god his glories nature object devotion but not wish write based upon jñāna therefore first engaged bhakti attain experiential realization vijñāna he wrote bhaktiyogena manasi samyak praṇihite male apaśhyat puruṣhaṁ pūrvaṁ māyāṁ cha tadapāśhrayām bhagavatam through bhaktiyog ved vyas fixed mind upon god without material sentiments thus attained complete vision realization supreme divine personality along his external energy maya his control inspired realization wrote epic scripturein verse lord shree krishna affirms arjun he bestow upon theoretical knowledge regarding supreme divine personality he also illuminate mind required wisdom once knowledge acquired nothing remaining know
7,3,मनुष्याणां सहस्रेषु कश्चिद्यतति सिद्धये | यततामपि सिद्धानां कश्चिन्मां वेत्ति तत्वत: ॥3॥,"Among thousands of men a rare one endeavours for perfection. Even of the perfected ones who are diligent, one perchance knows Me in truth.","The word siddhi has numerous connotations and meanings. As per the Sanskrit dictionary, a few of them are: attainment of supernatural power, accomplishment, success, performance, fulfillment, solution of a problem, completion of cooking or a task, healing, hitting the mark, maturing, supreme felicity, beatitude, an unusual skill or faculty, perfection.In this verse, Shree Krishna has used siddhi for perfection in the spiritual path. He says, “Only a tiny portion of the innumerable souls are fortunate to get a human birth. Amongst them, only a minuscule strive for spiritual perfection. And even among those perfected souls, ones who are aware of My divine glories and paramount position are very rare.” How is it that even perfected souls are unable to know God? The reason is without bhakti or loving devotion, it is not possible to realize the Supreme. Spiritual aspirants of karm, jñāna, haṭha yog, etc., cannot know God unless they include devotion in their practice.  Shree Krishna has stated this fact several times in the Bhagavad Gita:“The Supreme Divine Personality is greater than all that exists. Although He is all-pervading and all living beings are situated in Him, yet He can be known only through devotion.”  BG 8.22. “O Arjun, by unalloyed devotion alone can I be known as I am, standing before you. Thereby, on receiving my divine vision, O scorcher of foes, one can enter into union with me.”  BG 11.54“Only by loving devotion to me does one come to know who I am in truth. Then, having come to know me, my devotee enters into full consciousness of me.”  BG 18.55 Therefore, such spiritual aspirants who do not include devotion in their sadhana attain only limited theoretical knowledge or jñāna. And devoid of vijñāna the experiential knowledge, they are unable to know God or the Absolute Truth. Shree Krishna has stated in this verse that only one among numerous humans knows Him in Truth. In the next verse, He moves on to describe the material and spiritual dimensions of His energies.",the word siddhi numerous connotations meanings as per sanskrit dictionary attainment supernatural power accomplishment success performance fulfillment solution problem completion cooking task healing hitting mark maturing supreme felicity beatitude unusual skill faculty perfectionin verse shree krishna used siddhi perfection spiritual path he says only tiny portion innumerable souls fortunate get human birth amongst minuscule strive spiritual perfection and even among perfected souls ones aware my divine glories paramount position rare how even perfected souls unable know god the reason without bhakti loving devotion not possible realize supreme spiritual aspirants karm jñāna haṭha yog etc not know god unless include devotion practice shree krishna stated fact several times bhagavad gita the supreme divine personality greater exists although he allpervading living beings situated him yet he known devotion bg o arjun unalloyed devotion alone i known i standing thereby receiving divine vision o scorcher foes one enter union me bg only loving devotion one come know i truth then come know devotee enters full consciousness me bg therefore spiritual aspirants not include devotion sadhana attain limited theoretical knowledge jñāna and devoid vijñāna experiential knowledge unable know god absolute truth shree krishna stated verse one among numerous humans knows him truth in next verse he moves describe material spiritual dimensions his energies
7,4,भूमिरापोऽनलो वायु: खं मनो बुद्धिरेव च | अहङ्कार इतीयं मे भिन्ना प्रकृतिरष्टधा ॥4॥,"This Prakrti of Mine is divided eight-fold thus: earth, water, fire, air, space, mind, intellect and also egoism.","The energy that composes this material world is incredibly complex and fathomless. To make it comprehensible to our finite intellect, we have classified it into various categories and sub-categories.  Modern science propagates matter to be a combination of elements, and the 118 elements discovered so far, are sectioned under the Periodic Table.However, the Vedic philosophy and the Bhagavad Gita present a profoundly different classification of the material world. Matter is considered as part of God’s energy and called prakṛiti. It is further divided into eight forms, as listed in this verse. It is amazing how insightful the knowledge in these ancient scriptures is in comparison to the developing trends in modern science.Albert Einstein was the first to propound the concept of Mass-Energy Equivalence in 1905. In his Annus Mirabilis papers, he stated that it is possible to convert mass into energy and numerically presented it by an equation E=mc2. His Theory of Relativity replaced an earlier concept of the universe made of solid matter. Both these theories were challenged in 1920 by Niels Bohr and other scientists with Quantum Theory, which proposes a dual particle-wave nature of matter. Ever since, the scientific community has been on the lookout for a single field or Unified Field Theory, which could expound on the relationship between matter and all forces of the universe.More than 5000 years ago, long before the development of modern science, Lord Krishna had disclosed the perfect Unified Field Theory. He said to Arjun, “All that exists in the universe has manifested from My material energy.” Just one material energy has extended itself into myriad shapes, forms, and entities of this world. The Taittirīya Upaniṣhad has elaborated on this:tasmadvā etasmādātmana ākāśhaḥ sambhūtaḥākāśhādvāyuḥ vāyoragniḥ agnerāpaḥ adbhyaḥ pṛithivīpṛithivyā oṣhadhayaḥ oṣhadhībhyo ’nnam annātpuruṣhaḥsa vā eṣha puruṣho ’nnarasamayaḥ   (2.1.2)""From My material energy the ākāśhaḥ (ether) was created, from ether the air; from air, fire; from fire, water; from water, earth; from earth, plants; from plants, food and from food, man. This man is made of food-essence.""The material energy in its primordial form is called prakṛiti. God glances at it when He wishes to create the world. His glance agitates and creates mahān. (There is no equivalent word for it in English, as modern science is yet to discover such a subtle level of energy) Mahān further manifests into ahankār even this is unknown to modern science. Ahankār, in turn, forms the pañch-tanmātrās or the five perceptions of – taste, touch, smell, sight, and sound. And from these, the five gross elements— space, air, fire, water, and earth manifest.Lord Shree Krishna includes the mind, intellect, and ego along with the five gross elements as different manifestations of His material energy. In this verse, He states that all these eight elements are simply parts of Maya, His material energy. In the next verse, He describes another of His superior energy; the soul energy.",the energy composes material world incredibly complex fathomless to make comprehensible finite intellect classified various categories subcategories modern science propagates matter combination elements elements discovered far sectioned periodic tablehowever vedic philosophy bhagavad gita present profoundly different classification material world matter considered part god energy called prakṛiti it divided eight forms listed verse it amazing insightful knowledge ancient scriptures comparison developing trends modern sciencealbert einstein first propound concept massenergy equivalence in annus mirabilis papers stated possible convert mass energy numerically presented equation his theory relativity replaced earlier concept universe made solid matter both theories challenged niels bohr scientists quantum theory proposes dual particlewave nature matter ever since scientific community lookout single field unified field theory could expound relationship matter forces universemore years ago long development modern science lord krishna disclosed perfect unified field theory he said arjun all exists universe manifested my material energy just one material energy extended myriad shapes forms entities world the taittirīya upaniṣhad elaborated tasmadvā etasmādātmana ākāśhaḥ sambhūtaḥākāśhādvāyuḥ vāyoragniḥ agnerāpaḥ adbhyaḥ pṛithivīpṛithivyā oṣhadhayaḥ oṣhadhībhyo nnam annātpuruṣhaḥsa vā eṣha puruṣho nnarasamayaḥ from my material energy ākāśhaḥ ether created ether air air fire fire water water earth earth plants plants food food man this man made foodessence the material energy primordial form called prakṛiti god glances he wishes create world his glance agitates creates mahān there equivalent word english modern science yet discover subtle level energy mahān manifests ahankār even unknown modern science ahankār turn forms pañchtanmātrās five perceptions taste touch smell sight sound and five gross space air fire water earth manifestlord shree krishna includes mind intellect ego along five gross elements different manifestations his material energy in verse he states eight elements simply parts maya his material energy in next verse he describes another his superior energy soul energy
7,5,अपरेयमितस्त्वन्यां प्रकृतिं विद्धि मे पराम् | जीवभूतां महाबाहो ययेदं धार्यते जगत् ॥5॥,"O mighty-armed one, this is the inferior (Prakrti). Know the other Prakrti of Mine which, however, is higher than this, which has taken the form of individual souls, and by which this world is upheld.","Shree Krishna explains that beyond the eight-fold prakṛiti, the material energy, which He says is inferior; there exists another that is far more superior. This energy is completely transcendental as compared to the lifeless matter. It is His spiritual energy, the jīva śhakti, which includes all the living souls of the world. Now, He has moved from explaining material science toward the spiritual realm.Many great philosophers of India have given their perspectives and described the relationship between God and the jīva, the individual soul.  For example, the non-dualists state: jīvo brahmaiva nāparaḥ “The soul itself is God.”  But this concept gives rise to several questions, such as:How can the soul itself be God? God is most powerful, and Maya is His subservient energy. The souls are always overpowered by; Maya. Then is Maya stronger than God?The individual soul is always; gripped by ignorance and misery. It needs a continuous reminder from the saints and scriptures, even about its existence and purpose. How can God, who is all-knowing, be considered a soul which is subject to ignorance?The Vedas repeatedly state that God is all-pervading in this world and beyond. Similarly, individual souls should also be able to exist anywhere at any given time. Then what about the question of going to heaven or hell after death?There is only one God, but the souls are countless. If the soul itself is God, then there should be many Gods. Therefore, the claims by non-dualistic philosophers that the soul itself is God are inconclusive.The dualist philosophers’ state that the souls and God are separate. Even though it may answer some of the above questions, yet it is still an incomplete philosophy in light of what Shree Krishna states in this verse. He says that the soul is a part of jīva śhakti God’s spiritual energy. And as explained earlier, Maya, the material energy, is also His subservient. Thus, God is supreme; He is the governor of both the lower material and the higher spiritual energies. Now let us see what the scriptures and various saints have said:eka-deśha-sthitasyāgnir jyotsnā vistāriṇī yathāparasya brahmaṇaḥ śhaktis tathedam akhilaṁ jagat  (Viṣhṇu Purāṇ 1.22.53)“Just as the sun resides in one place but its sunlight pervades; the entire solar system. Similarly, there is one God, who by His infinite powers pervades the three worlds.” Chaitanya Mahaprabhu said:        jīva-tattva śhakti, kṛiṣhṇa-tattva śhaktimāngītā-viṣhṇupurāṇādi tāhāte pramāṇa   (Chaitanya Charitāmṛit, Ādi Leela, 7.117)“The soul is the energy of God, while He is the Supreme Energetic.”Once we understand and accept that the soul is a small part of God’s infinite energy, the concept of non-duality of the entire creation becomes clear. Energies can exist concurrently within the same energetic. For example, fire contains both heat and light, which are different entities and have different properties. But they are part of the same fire which emits them. Likewise, God as the Energetic and the souls His energy can be considered one. At the same time, due to their distinct properties, both entities are different from each other. Jagadguru Kripaluji Maharaj has encapsulated and perfectly expressed Shree Krishna’s statement in this and the previous verse:jīvu’ ‘māyā’, dui śhakti haiñ, śhaktimān bhagavānśhaktihiñ bheda abheda bhī, śhaktimān te jān  (Bhakti Śhatak verse 42)“The soul and Maya are both energies of God.  Hence, they are both one with God and also different from God.”Considering the unison of both; the Energetic and His energies, it is stated that God and His creation are non-different. The entire world is a veritable form of God.sarvaṁ khalvidaṁ brahma   (Chhāndogya Upaniṣhad 3.14.1)“All is Brahman.”īśhāvāsyam idam sarvaṁ   (Īśhopaniṣhad 1)“Everything that exists in the world is God.”puruṣha evedaṁ sarvaṁ   (Śhwetāśhvatar Upaniṣhad 3.15)“The Supreme Divine Personality is everything that exists.”According to these Vedic verses, there is only one God and nothing else. Yet, when we consider the Energetic and energy concept, there is diversity within this unity and an incredible variety. God, the souls, and matter, all three are different entities with different properties. God is Supremely sentient; He is the source of both the souls and the matter. Yet, souls are sentient, and the matter insentient.The scriptures also state the existence of three entities in creation:kṣharaṁ pradhānamamṛitākṣharaṁ haraḥkṣharātmānāvīśhate deva ekaḥtasyābhidhyānād yojanāt tattvabhāvadbhūyaśhchānte viśhwamāyānivṛittiḥ (Śhwetāśhvatar Upaniṣhad 1.10)“There are three entities in existence: 1) Matter, which is perishable.  2) The individual souls who are imperishable.  3) God, who is the controller of both matter and the souls.  By meditating upon God, uniting with Him, and becoming more like Him, the soul is free from the world’s illusion.”The Vedas have expounded on both dualistic and non-dualistic concepts. Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj has upheld the concepts of concurrent coherence, yet variance between the soul and God. This means God and the soul are one; yet, separate from each other.",shree krishna explains beyond eightfold prakṛiti material energy he says inferior exists another far superior this energy completely transcendental compared lifeless matter it his spiritual energy jīva śhakti includes living souls world now he moved explaining material science toward spiritual realmmany great philosophers india given perspectives described relationship god jīva individual soul for example nondualists state jīvo brahmaiva nāparaḥ the soul god but concept gives rise several questions how soul god god powerful maya his subservient energy the souls always overpowered maya then maya stronger god the individual soul always gripped ignorance misery it needs continuous reminder saints scriptures even existence purpose how god allknowing considered soul subject ignorance the vedas repeatedly state god allpervading world beyond similarly individual souls also able exist anywhere given time then question going heaven hell death there one god souls countless if soul god many gods therefore claims nondualistic philosophers soul god inconclusivethe dualist philosophers state souls god separate even though may answer questions yet still incomplete philosophy light shree krishna states verse he says soul part jīva śhakti god spiritual energy and explained earlier maya material energy also his subservient thus god supreme he governor lower material higher spiritual energies now let us see scriptures various saints said ekadeśhasthitasyāgnir jyotsnā yathāparasya śhaktis tathedam akhilaṁ jagat viṣhṇu purāṇ just sun resides one place sunlight pervades entire solar system similarly one god his infinite powers pervades three worlds chaitanya mahaprabhu said jīvatattva śhakti kṛiṣhṇatattva śhaktimāngītāviṣhṇupurāṇādi tāhāte pramāṇa chaitanya charitāmṛit ādi leela the soul energy god he supreme energetic once understand accept soul small part god infinite energy concept nonduality entire creation becomes clear energies exist concurrently within energetic for example fire contains heat light different entities different properties but part fire emits likewise god energetic souls his energy considered one at time due distinct properties entities different jagadguru kripaluji maharaj encapsulated perfectly expressed shree krishna statement previous verse jīvu māyā dui śhakti haiñ śhaktimān bhagavānśhaktihiñ bheda abheda bhī śhaktimān te jān bhakti śhatak verse the soul maya energies god hence one god also different god considering unison energetic his energies stated god his creation nondifferent the entire world veritable form godsarvaṁ khalvidaṁ brahma chhāndogya upaniṣhad all brahman īśhāvāsyam idam sarvaṁ īśhopaniṣhad everything exists world god puruṣha evedaṁ sarvaṁ śhwetāśhvatar upaniṣhad the supreme divine personality everything exists according vedic verses one god nothing else yet consider energetic energy concept diversity within unity incredible variety god souls matter three different entities different properties god supremely sentient he source souls matter yet souls sentient matter insentientthe scriptures also state existence three entities creation kṣharaṁ pradhānamamṛitākṣharaṁ haraḥkṣharātmānāvīśhate deva ekaḥtasyābhidhyānād yojanāt tattvabhāvadbhūyaśhchānte viśhwamāyānivṛittiḥ śhwetāśhvatar upaniṣhad there three entities existence matter perishable the individual souls imperishable god controller matter souls by meditating upon god uniting him becoming like him soul free world illusion the vedas expounded dualistic nondualistic concepts jagadguru shree kripaluji maharaj upheld concepts concurrent coherence yet variance soul god this means god soul one yet separate

I am the origin as also the end of the whole Universe.,"Living beings are a manifestation of God’s two energies, jīva śhakti, the sentient soul energy, and Maya, the insentient material energy or matter. In the material realm, all life is a combination of both matter and soul. Matter by itself is insentient or lifeless, and the sentient soul needs a carrier body. Hence, both come together to form a living being.Similarly, the entire creation is a manifestation of God’s energies. One cycle of creation lasts for 100 years of Brahma. Then the Supreme Lord starts the process of dissolution. The five gross elements merge into five subtle elements, which in turn merge into ahankār. Ahankār goes back into mahān, which again unites with prakṛiti.  Prakṛiti now resides inside the body of Maha Vishnu (another form of the Supreme Lord).  All the materially bound souls, which could not get liberated during this cycle of creation, also reside in God’s body. They remain unmanifested, waiting for the next cycle of creation.When God decides to create, the entire cycle begins all over again (as explained in verse 7.4), and a new world comes into existence. Therefore, God is the source, the sustainer, and the resting place for the entire creation.",living beings manifestation god two energies jīva śhakti sentient soul energy maya insentient material energy matter in material realm life combination matter soul matter insentient lifeless sentient soul needs carrier body hence come together form living beingsimilarly entire creation manifestation god energies one cycle creation lasts years brahma then supreme lord starts process dissolution the five gross elements merge five subtle elements turn merge ahankār ahankār goes back mahān unites prakṛiti prakṛiti resides inside body maha vishnu another form supreme lord all materially bound souls could not get liberated cycle creation also reside god body they remain unmanifested waiting next cycle creationwhen god decides create entire cycle begins explained verse new world comes existence therefore god source sustainer resting place entire creation

All this is strung on Me like pearls on a string.","Here, Lord Shree Krishna states about His dominion and His Supreme position in this universe. He is the Substratum over which this entire creation exists; He is the Creator, Sustainer, and Annihilator. Similar to the beads strung in a thread, which can move in their place, God has given individual souls the free will to act as they wish, yet their existence is bound to Him.  The Śhwetāśhvatar Upaniṣhad states:na tatsamaśhchābhyadhikaśhcha dṛiśhyateparāsya śhaktirvividhaiva śhrūyate  (6.8)“There is nothing equal to God, nor is there anything superior to Him.”In this verse, Lord Shree Krishna has clearly stated that He, in His original form, who stood before Arjun is the Ultimate Supreme Truth. By using the words, Me, My and I, He has dispelled the doubts that many have about Lord Shree Krishna Himself being God, the Supreme Lord. As many suppose that there is another higher formless entity, who is the ultimate source of even Lord Shree Krishna. As the first-born Brahma prays to Lord Shree Krishna:īśhwaraḥ paramaḥ kṛiṣhṇaḥ sachchidānanda vigrahaḥanādirādir govindaḥ sarva kāraṇa kāraṇam  (Brahma Samhitā 5.1)“Shree Krishna is the Supreme Lord, who is eternal, omniscient, and infinite bliss.  He is without beginning and end, the origin of all, and the cause of all causes.”",here lord shree krishna states his dominion his supreme position universe he substratum entire creation exists he creator sustainer annihilator similar beads strung thread move place god given individual souls free act wish yet existence bound him the śhwetāśhvatar upaniṣhad states na tatsamaśhchābhyadhikaśhcha dṛiśhyateparāsya śhaktirvividhaiva śhrūyate there nothing equal god anything superior him in verse lord shree krishna clearly stated he his original form stood arjun ultimate supreme truth by using words me my i he dispelled doubts many lord shree krishna himself god supreme lord as many suppose another higher formless entity ultimate source even lord shree krishna as firstborn brahma prays lord shree krishna īśhwaraḥ paramaḥ kṛiṣhṇaḥ sachchidānanda vigrahaḥanādirādir govindaḥ sarva kāraṇa kāraṇam brahma samhitā shree krishna supreme lord eternal omniscient infinite bliss he without beginning end origin cause causes

Now, He continues to explain it further in these four verses.The sweet taste of any fruit that we eat confirms the presence of Fructose or fruit sugar in it. Similarly, Shree Krishna reveals that He is present in all the modifications of His energies. He says He is the taste in water. What does that mean? Water hardly has any taste of its own. Yet, other forms of matter such as solids, fires, and gases need liquids to carry their taste.Have you ever tried putting a solid food item, on your dry tongue? Do you get any taste? Only when the saliva in our mouth dissolves some part of the solid, we start getting the taste as perceived by the taste buds on our tongue. After all, who can separate the taste of water from water? That is why Shree Krishna says that he is the taste in water. It is the intrinsic property of water to carry the taste of all substances; without water, there will be no taste.In the same way, ākāśha (space) acts as the vehicle for sound. Different languages form due to sound modifications. Shree Krishna says He is the origin of it all, as the sound in space is His energy. He is the syllable Om the most important sound in the Vedic mantras. The sun and the moon get their radiance from Him. Even for all the abilities that manifest in humans, He is the ultimate energy source.",shree krishna said previous verse he origin sustainer basis exists world now he continues explain four versesthe sweet taste fruit eat confirms presence fructose fruit sugar similarly shree krishna reveals he present modifications his energies he says he taste water what mean water hardly taste yet forms matter solids fires gases need liquids carry tastehave ever tried putting solid food item dry tongue do get taste only saliva mouth dissolves part solid start getting taste perceived taste buds tongue after separate taste water water that shree krishna says taste water it intrinsic property water carry taste substances without water tastein way ākāśha space acts vehicle sound different languages form due sound modifications shree krishna says he origin sound space his energy he syllable om important sound vedic mantras the sun moon get radiance him even abilities manifest humans he ultimate energy source

The entire universe is an extension of His opulence. On Earth, He is the force behind both the non-living and the living. He is the mild and pure fragrance of the earth and the bright radiance of a flame. He is the life-force of all living creatures. The ascetics or sadhus consciously deny themselves of bodily pleasures and perform austerities for self-purification.

7,10,बीजं मां सर्वभूतानां विद्धि पार्थ सनातनम् | बुद्धिर्बुद्धिमतामस्मि तेजस्तेजस्विनामहम् ॥10॥,"O Partha, know Me to be the eternal Seed of all beings. I am the intellect of the intelligent, I am the courage of the courageous.","In a cause and effect relationship, every cause is the seed of its effect. For example, an ocean is the seed of the clouds, and the clouds are the seed for rain. Similarly, Shree Krishna says in this verse that He is the cause (the eternal seed) from which all beings manifest.Have you ever thought about why some people are more intelligent than others? Why do they have greater brilliance in their thoughts and ideas? The only explanation for this can be; since all that exists is a manifestation of God’s energy. The splendid qualities visible in such outstanding people can only be due to God’s grace. As Shree Krishna has mentioned in this verse, He is the subtle force behind the intelligent and the glorious. He makes their minds more analytic and thoughts scintillating.Legend of modern history, such as William Shakespeare, displayed unmatched brilliance in the field of literature. That could have only been possible by God’s grace. His works have nourished English literature, and English has now become the most used language of the world. Swami Vivekananda once said: the British Empire has united the world in one language. Another such genius is Bill Gates, who changed the course of information technology with his Windows Operating System. With more than ninety percent of market share, Windows has become the most popular Operating System in the world. As it is very user-friendly, it has made information technology available to the public at large. The usage of computers is not limited to IT engineers anymore. Such inspiration to have one major operating system to unify the information technology industry and ensure proper interaction could only be through God’s plan. God enhances one such person’s intellect when he wants to save us from chaos.Of course, the saints have always acknowledged that the brilliance and beauty of their works are due to God’s special grace. Sage Tulsidas said:  na maiñ kiyā na kari sakauñ, sahiba kartā morkarata karāvata āap haiñ, tulasī tulasī śhor“Neither did I write the Ramayan, nor do I have the ability to write it.  The Lord is my Doer.  He directs my actions and acts through me, but the world thinks that Tulsidas is doing them.”  Therefore, Lord Shree Krishna is indeed the ultimate source of all the brilliance and intelligence that manifests around us.",in cause effect relationship every cause seed effect for example ocean seed clouds clouds seed rain similarly shree krishna says verse he cause eternal seed beings manifesthave ever thought people intelligent others why greater brilliance thoughts ideas the explanation since exists manifestation god energy the splendid qualities visible outstanding people due god grace as shree krishna mentioned verse he subtle force behind intelligent glorious he makes minds analytic thoughts scintillatinglegend modern history william shakespeare displayed unmatched brilliance field literature that could possible god grace his works nourished english literature english become used language world swami vivekananda said british empire united world one language another genius bill gates changed course information technology windows operating system with ninety percent market share windows become popular operating system world as userfriendly made information technology available public large the usage computers not limited it engineers anymore such inspiration one major operating system unify information technology industry ensure proper interaction could god plan god enhances one person intellect wants save us chaosof course saints always acknowledged brilliance beauty works due god special grace sage tulsidas said na maiñ kiyā na kari sakauñ sahiba kartā morkarata karāvata āap haiñ tulasī tulasī śhor neither i write ramayan i ability write the lord doer he directs actions acts world thinks tulsidas them therefore lord shree krishna indeed ultimate source brilliance intelligence manifests around us

Fueled with passion, one achieves and experiences the desired objects. But this causes attachment, which is a passive mental emotion that provokes the thirst for more. Therefore, when Shree Krishna states kāma-rāga-vivarjitam; He means “devoid of passion and attachment.” Explaining the nature of His strength, He says that He is the serene and sublime strength in people, which empowers them; to successfully fulfill their duties and responsibilities. When sexual activity is undertaken only for sensual pleasure and is devoid of any regulative principles, it is considered beastly or animalistic. Whereas, it is regarded, in line with the scriptural injunctions and not a contrary virtue, when carried out for procreation by a householder. Here, Shree Krishna has mentioned that within the institution of marriage, He is the controlled, virtuous, and well-intended sexual activity of a householder.",desire active craving things not attained fueled passion one achieves experiences desired objects but causes attachment passive mental emotion provokes thirst therefore shree krishna states kāmarāgavivarjitam he means devoid passion attachment explaining nature his strength he says he serene sublime strength people empowers successfully fulfill duties responsibilities when sexual activity undertaken sensual pleasure devoid regulative principles considered beastly animalistic whereas regarded line scriptural injunctions not contrary virtue carried procreation householder here shree krishna mentioned within institution marriage he controlled virtuous wellintended sexual activity householder

He says, “Arjun, I have explained how I am the essence of all objects.  But there is no point in going into detail.  All good-bad and ugly objects and states of existence are made possible only by My energy.”Even though the entire creation originates from God, He is beyond His creation and independent of it. A famous poet Alfred Tennyson stated in his poem “In Memorium:”Our little systems have their day;They have their day and cease to be.They are but broken lights of thee,And thou, O Lord, art more than they.",in verse shree krishna sums his glories he described previous four verses he says arjun i explained i essence objects but point going detail all goodbad ugly objects states existence made possible my energy even though entire creation originates god he beyond his creation independent a famous poet alfred tennyson stated poem in memorium our little systems day they day cease bethey broken lights thee and thou o lord art

These veil the human consciousness and cause fascination with the bodily pleasures which are short-lived. The word “Maya” is made from mā (not) and yā (what is).  Thus, Maya means “that which is not what it appears to be.”Maya, being one of God’s energy, is engaged in the service of hiding His true nature from the souls who are not yet eligible or God-realized. It lures and confuses the souls who are already vimukh (having their backs turned) from God. It also troubles them with problems and difficulties aided by the three-fold material miseries. By this, Maya makes the souls realize that they can never be happy unless they are sanmukh (their face turned) toward God.",the omniscience lord krishna aware following question come arjun mind if vibhutis opulence humans forget supreme creator controller entire creation shree krishna says humans deluded three modes maya his material energy ignorance passion goodness these veil human consciousness cause fascination bodily pleasures shortlived the word maya made mā not yā thus maya means not appears be maya one god energy engaged service hiding his true nature souls not yet eligible godrealized it lures confuses souls already vimukh backs turned god it also troubles problems difficulties aided threefold material miseries by maya makes souls realize never happy unless sanmukh face turned toward god
7,14,दैवी ह्येषा गुणमयी मम माया दुरत्यया | मामेव ये प्रपद्यन्ते मायामेतां तरन्ति ते ॥14॥,"Since this divine Maya of Mine which is constituted by the gunas is difficult to cross over, (therefore) those who take refuge in Me alone cross over this Maya.","Some people claim that Maya is mithyā (non-existent).  They say that the material energy Maya is a perception created due to our ignorance, but if someone attains spiritual knowledge, Maya will cease to exist. The soul itself is the Ultimate Reality, and once we understand that, all illusions shall dispel. However, this theory is negated by the Bhagavad Gita in this verse. Shree Krishna has already stated that Maya is an extension of His energy and not an illusion. The Śhwetāśhvatar Upaniṣhad also states: māyāṁ tu prakṛitiṁ vidyānmāyinaṁ tu maheśhvaram   (4.10)“Maya is the energy (prakṛiti), while God is the Energetic.” The Ramayan states:      so dāsī raghubīra ki samujheṅ mithyā sopi“Some people think Maya is mithyā (non-existent), but factually it is an energy engaged in the service of God.” Shree Krishna has mentioned here that because Maya is His energy, it is difficult to overcome. If someone claims they have defeated Maya, that would mean they have defeated God. No one can conquer God; therefore, Maya is equally invincible. The human mind is made of Maya merely by self-effort no yogi, jñānī, ascetic, or karmī can successfully control the mind. One could then ask, “Is it impossible to overcome Maya?” The second line of this verse has the answer to this question. Shree Krishna says, “Those who surrender themselves to Me, the Supreme Lord, then by My grace, they would smoothly cross the ocean of material existence. I will instruct Maya to leave this soul, now that it has become Mine.” On God’s instructions Maya, the material energy of God, simply releases the surrendered soul from its clutches. It says, “My job is to keep troubling the soul until it surrenders at the feet of God; once the soul reaches there, my job is complete.”Here is an example from everyday life. Assume that you visit a friend who has a large house, outside on the gate, a board says, “Beware of dog.” When you look inside, a trained guard dog is standing on the lawn. As soon as it spots you, it starts growling menacingly, scared; you decide to take the back gate. But even before you reach the back of the house, it is waiting there for you and snarls furiously, as if saying, “You dare step into this house.” You have no choice, and you shout your friend’s name aloud. Hearing all the commotion, your friend comes and finds you at the gate troubled by his dog. He sternly says to the dog, “No, Tommy, that is a friend, we need to let him in, come and sit down here.” Hearing his master’s command, the dog silently goes and sits near him. You can now open the gate and let yourself in without fear.In the same way, we are in the clutches of Maya, the material energy. Although it is subservient to God, it keeps troubling us so that we keep moving towards God. By our own efforts, we cannot defeat Maya; only when we surrender completely to God, by His grace, we can cross the ocean of material existence. The next question in our mind would be, “If it is so easy to defeat Maya, then why is it that most of us fail?” Shree Krishna has elaborated on that in the next verse.",some people claim maya mithyā nonexistent they say material energy maya perception created due ignorance someone attains spiritual knowledge maya cease exist the soul ultimate reality understand illusions shall dispel however theory negated bhagavad gita verse shree krishna already stated maya extension his energy not illusion the śhwetāśhvatar upaniṣhad also states māyāṁ tu prakṛitiṁ vidyānmāyinaṁ tu maheśhvaram maya energy prakṛiti god energetic the ramayan states dāsī raghubīra ki samujheṅ mithyā sopi some people think maya mithyā nonexistent factually energy engaged service god shree krishna mentioned maya his energy difficult overcome if someone claims defeated maya would mean defeated god no one conquer god therefore maya equally invincible the human mind made maya merely selfeffort yogi jñānī ascetic karmī successfully control mind one could ask is impossible overcome maya the second line verse answer question shree krishna says those surrender me supreme lord my grace would smoothly cross ocean material existence i instruct maya leave soul become mine on god instructions maya material energy god simply releases surrendered soul clutches it says my job keep troubling soul surrenders feet god soul reaches job complete here example everyday life assume visit friend large house outside gate board says beware dog when look inside trained guard dog standing lawn as soon spots starts growling menacingly scared decide take back gate but even reach back house waiting snarls furiously saying you dare step house you choice shout friend name aloud hearing commotion friend comes finds gate troubled dog he sternly says dog no tommy friend need let come sit here hearing master command dog silently goes sits near you open gate let without fearin way clutches maya material energy although subservient god keeps troubling us keep moving towards god by efforts not defeat maya surrender completely god his grace cross ocean material existence the next question mind would if easy defeat maya us fail shree krishna elaborated next verse
7,15,न मां दुष्कृतिनो मूढा: प्रपद्यन्ते नराधमा: | माययापहृतज्ञाना आसुरं भावमाश्रिता: ॥15॥,"The foolish evildoers, who are the most depraved among men, who are deprived of (their) wisdom by Maya, and who resort to demoniacal ways, do not take refuge in Me.","In this verse, Shree Krishna says that there are four categories of people who do not surrender to Him:1. The Ignorant. People who lack spiritual knowledge and do not know anything about the soul being eternal and that its ultimate goal is God-realization. They have never heard about these concepts or aware of the process of surrendering to God.2. The lazy. These are the ones who have the knowledge and awareness of what they need to do still, due to their lazy-nature do not want to take any initiative to surrender. Laziness can be a big pitfall for someone on the path of spirituality. There is a Sanskrit saying: ālasya hī manuṣhyāṇāṁ śharīrastho mahān ripuḥnāstyudyamasamo bandhuḥ kṛitvā yaṁ nāvasīdati“Laziness is a big enemy, and it resides; in our body itself.  Work is a good friend of humans, which never leads to downfall.”3. Deluded Intellects. People who are so proud of their intellects that they have no faith in the scriptures and the teachings of the saints. Because they do not have faith, they are unable to practice surrender or understand the concepts of God-realization.4. Demonic Nature. These are the people who are aware of God and His purpose for the world but still work against Him.  It is because of their demonic nature; they do not like God and His glories. They themselves are far from devotion and try to disturb others who are on the path of spirituality. Surrender to God is not at all expected from them.",in verse shree krishna says four categories people not surrender the ignorant people lack spiritual knowledge not know anything soul eternal ultimate goal godrealization they never heard concepts aware process surrendering the lazy these ones knowledge awareness need still due lazynature not want take initiative surrender laziness big pitfall someone path spirituality there sanskrit saying ālasya hī manuṣhyāṇāṁ śharīrastho mahān ripuḥnāstyudyamasamo bandhuḥ kṛitvā yaṁ nāvasīdati laziness big enemy resides body work good friend humans never leads downfall deluded intellects people proud intellects faith scriptures teachings saints because not faith unable practice surrender understand concepts demonic nature these people aware god his purpose world still work him it demonic nature not like god his glories they far devotion try disturb others path spirituality surrender god not expected
7,16,चतुर्विधा भजन्ते मां जना: सुकृतिनोऽर्जुन | आर्तो जिज्ञासुरर्थार्थी ज्ञानी च भरतर्षभ ॥16॥,"O Arjuna, foremost of the Bharata dynasty, four classes of people of virtuous deeds adore Me: the afflicted, the seeker of Knowledge, the seeker of wealth and the man of Knowledge.","In the previous verse, Shree Krishna described the four categories of people who do not surrender to Him. Now He describes; the other four kinds who take refuge in Him.1. The distressed. Those who find that their pot of worldly miseries is overflowing, and they are unable to cope with them conclude that it is futile running after the world. Thus, decide to take shelter in God. Similarly, those who find that the worldly supports fail to protect them; turn to God for protection. An apt example in the Mahabharata was Draupadi’s surrender to Shree Krishna when Duryodhan and Dushasan tried to dishonor her in the courtroom of Hastinapur. Initially, she expected her husbands would protect her, but they did not. She pleaded the elders in the courtroom, Bheeshma, Vidur, Dhritarashtra, Dronacharya, Kripacharya, etc. However, everyone remained speechless. When cruel Dushasan tried to disrobe her, she clenched her sari with her teeth and tried to protect her honor with her own strength. But her teeth could not hold on to the sari for long; they gave in to Dushasan’s strength. She was helpless and finally called out to Shree Krishna for help. It was at this point that she surrendered completely to God and was not relying on anyone or her own strength for protection. Shree Krishna reciprocated immediately and intervened. Now, how much ever Dushasan pulled, Draupadi’s sari kept extending, and very soon, there was a huge pile of cloth in the middle of the courtroom. Dushasan was unable to disrobe Draupadi; exhausted, he gave up. Such was the power of God’s protection, but it came only when Draupadi surrendered completely.2. The knowledge seekers. There are some people who have heard about the opulence of God and His spiritual realm. Thus, they are curious to know all about God and try to seek Him through knowledge.3. The seekers of worldly possessions. Some people are clear about what they want and take the shelter of God because they are convinced; that only God can provide what they are seeking. King Dhruv is an apt example. When Dhruv was a small boy, he felt neglected by his father, King Uttanapada. Disheartened, he went into the forest and did penance to please God. He wanted to become more powerful than his father. But as his devotion grew, he realized that God possessed the priceless jewel of divine love, and what he was seeking was like broken pieces of glass. Therefore, when pleased with his devotion, God gave him darshan, he requested the Lord to bestow upon him; self-less pure love.4. Those situated in knowledge. Lastly, those souls who have understood the truth that they are tiny parts of God. Such people engage in devotion with the intent that it is their eternal duty to love and serve Him. Shree Krishna calls them the fourth kind of devotees.",in previous verse shree krishna described four categories people not surrender him now he describes four kinds take refuge the distressed those find pot worldly miseries overflowing unable cope conclude futile running world thus decide take shelter god similarly find worldly supports fail protect turn god protection an apt example mahabharata draupadi surrender shree krishna duryodhan dushasan tried dishonor courtroom hastinapur initially expected husbands would protect not she pleaded elders courtroom bheeshma vidur dhritarashtra dronacharya kripacharya etc however everyone remained speechless when cruel dushasan tried disrobe clenched sari teeth tried protect honor strength but teeth could not hold sari long gave dushasan strength she helpless finally called shree krishna help it point surrendered completely god not relying anyone strength protection shree krishna reciprocated immediately intervened now much ever dushasan pulled draupadi sari kept extending soon huge pile cloth middle courtroom dushasan unable disrobe draupadi exhausted gave such power god protection came draupadi surrendered the knowledge seekers there people heard opulence god his spiritual realm thus curious know god try seek him the seekers worldly possessions some people clear want take shelter god convinced god provide seeking king dhruv apt example when dhruv small boy felt neglected father king uttanapada disheartened went forest penance please god he wanted become powerful father but devotion grew realized god possessed priceless jewel divine love seeking like broken pieces glass therefore pleased devotion god gave darshan requested lord bestow upon selfless pure those situated knowledge lastly souls understood truth tiny parts god such people engage devotion intent eternal duty love serve him shree krishna calls fourth kind devotees

For I am very much dear to the man of Knowledge, and he too is dear to Me.","Shree Krishan says in this verse that those who are seeking God in distress, for worldly gains or out of curiosity, etc. are yet to possess selfless devotion. Gradually in the process of devotion, their hearts become pure, and they realize their eternal relationship with God. Then they develop selfless, exclusive, and incessant devotion toward Him. Now that they have the knowledge that the happiness of the world is temporary and God is the source of eternal bliss, they neither crave for favorable circumstances nor lament over reversals in the world. They become situated in selfless devotion with complete self-surrender. And for their Divine Beloved, they are willing to offer themselves as an offering in the fire of divine love.

7,18,उदारा: सर्व एवैते ज्ञानी त्वात्मैव मे मतम् | आस्थित: स हि युक्तात्मा मामेवानुत्तमां गतिम् ॥18॥,"All of these, indeed, are noble, but the man of Knowledge is the very Self. (This is) My opinion. For, with a steadfast mind, he is set on the path leading to Me alone who am the super-excellent Goal.","In the previous verse, Shree Krishna stated that the devotees situated in knowledge or jñānī bhakt are the highest. However, He clarifies in this verse that whatever may be the reason for their devotion, all His devotees are privileged; even the other three kinds are blessed souls. But the devotees seated in knowledge worship God selflessly, without expecting any material gains in return. Hence, the unconditional love of such selfless devotees even binds God.Worldly love; is driven by the desire for self-gratification. There is a give and take attitude, and there is an expectation of receiving something in return from the beloved. However, Parā bhakti or divine love is totally different. It is filled with the desire for the happiness of the Divine Beloved and sacrifice in His service. Divine love fosters a giving attitude without expecting anything in return.Chaitanya Mahaprabhu said:kāmera tātparya nija-sambhoga kevalakṛiṣhṇa-sukha-tātparya-mātra prema ta’ prabalaataeva kāma-preme bahuta antarakāma andha-tamaḥ, prema nirmala bhāskara(Chaitanya Charitāmṛit, Ādi Leela, 4.166 & 171)[v16]“Lust (worldly love) exists for self-happiness; divine love is harbored for Shree Krishna’s happiness. There is a tremendous difference between them—lust is like darkness and ignorance, while divine love is pure and illuminating.”Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj has very beautifully stated:brahma lok paryanta sukh, aru muktihuñ sukh tyāg,tabai dharahu paga prema patha, nahiṅ lagi jaiheñ dāg.(Bhakti Śhatak verse 45)[v17]“Give up the desires for worldly pleasures and that of liberation if you wish to walk the path of devotion. Else the pure waters of divine love will get tainted with selfishness.”Sage Narad defined pure devotion in this manner:tat sukha sukhitvam    (Nārad Bhakti Darśhan, Sūtra 24)[v18]“True love is for the happiness of the Beloved.” The materially motivated devotees cannot engage in such devotion, but the devotee who is in knowledge rises to this level of selflessness. When someone learns to love God in this manner, he becomes a slave of that Devotee. The highest quality of God is bhakta vatsaltā (his love for his devotees). The Puraṇas state:gītvā cha mama nāmāni vicharenmama sannidhauiti bravīmi te satyaṁ krītohaṁ tasya chārjuna (Ādi Purāṇ 1.2.231)[v19]Shree Krishna says: “I become the slave of those devotees of mine, who chant my names and keep me close to them in their thoughts; this is a fact, O Arjun.”In this verse Shree Krishna goes to the extent of saying that bound by the devotion and love of His selfless devotees, He looks upon them as Himself.",in previous verse shree krishna stated devotees situated knowledge jñānī bhakt highest however he clarifies verse whatever may reason devotion his devotees privileged even three kinds blessed souls but devotees seated knowledge worship god selflessly without expecting material gains return hence unconditional love selfless devotees even binds godworldly love driven desire selfgratification there give take attitude expectation receiving something return beloved however parā bhakti divine love totally different it filled desire happiness divine beloved sacrifice his service divine love fosters giving attitude without expecting anything returnchaitanya mahaprabhu said kāmera tātparya nijasambhoga kevalakṛiṣhṇasukhatātparyamātra prema ta prabalaataeva kāmapreme bahuta antarakāma andhatamaḥ prema nirmala bhāskara chaitanya charitāmṛit ādi leela lust worldly love exists selfhappiness divine love harbored shree krishna happiness there tremendous difference like darkness ignorance divine love pure illuminating jagadguru shree kripaluji maharaj beautifully stated brahma lok paryanta sukh aru muktihuñ sukh tyāg tabai dharahu paga prema patha nahiṅ lagi jaiheñ dāg bhakti śhatak verse give desires worldly pleasures liberation wish walk path devotion else pure waters divine love get tainted selfishness sage narad defined pure devotion manner tat sukha sukhitvam nārad bhakti darśhan sūtra true love happiness beloved the materially motivated devotees not engage devotion devotee knowledge rises level selflessness when someone learns love god manner becomes slave devotee the highest quality god bhakta vatsaltā love devotees the puraṇas state gītvā cha mama nāmāni vicharenmama sannidhauiti bravīmi te satyaṁ krītohaṁ tasya chārjuna ādi purāṇ shree krishna says i become slave devotees mine chant names keep close thoughts fact o arjun in verse shree krishna goes extent saying bound devotion love his selfless devotees he looks upon himself
7,19,बहूनां जन्मनामन्ते ज्ञानवान्मां प्रपद्यते | वासुदेव: सर्वमिति स महात्मा सुदुर्लभ: ॥19॥,"At the end of many births the man of Knowledge attains Me, (realizing) that Vasudeva is all. Such a high-souled one is very rare.","In this verse, Shree Krishna clears this common perception of the intellectually inclined people that bhakti (devotion) is inferior to jñāna (knowledge). They are disdainful towards people engaged in devotion. They look down upon them and consider themselves to be superior as they are engaged in the brainy act of acquiring knowledge. Whereas, Shree Krishna declares that a jñānī spends several lifetimes cultivating knowledge and only when his or her jñāna matures does he finally surrender to God. In fact, it is true knowledge that leads to devotion.Let us look at this example of a man who was walking on the beach.  He steps upon an object on the sand and finds it to be a golden ring. He thinks of it as artificial jewellery worth $10, keeps it in his pocket, and forgets about it. After a few days, he remembers it and shows it to a friend, who is a goldsmith. He checks it and says, “This is pure gold and worth at least $500”. The man feels thrilled to have found something precious and wears it every day. A few days pass by, and his uncle visits him, who is a jeweller. The uncle looks at the ring and says, “The stone on your gold ring is a precious diamond. Where did you get this? It costs more than $50,000.” On hearing this, the man is overwhelmed and could not believe what his uncle just said. His uncle understood this and said, “It seems, you don’t believe me, I am willing to pay you $40,000 for it.” Now, the man feels elated as if he has won a lottery. He loves the diamond-studded gold ring much more, now that he knows its real value.This example demonstrates the direct relationship between knowledge and love. When the value of the ring was perceived by the man to be less, his love for it was also lesser as his knowledge of its value increased, the love for it, and the joy he got from it also kept increasing.  The Ramayan states:jāneṅ binu na hoi paratītī, binu paratīti hoi nahiṅ prītī [v20]“Without knowledge, there cannot be faith; without faith, love cannot grow.”Similarly, if someone has acquired true knowledge and claims to know the Brahman, then love for Him comes naturally. Else their knowledge is merely theoretical if they do not feel the love that fosters devotion.Shree Krishna says that jñānīs spend several lifetimes seeking true knowledge, and when their knowledge matures into true wisdom, that the Supreme Lord is all that is; they surrender to Him. However, He does not say this for the jñānīs, karmīs, haṭha-yogis, ascetics, etc. He declares this for the devotees or such exalted souls who have realized “God is all that is” and surrendered to Him. Nevertheless, such noble souls are very rare.",in verse shree krishna clears common perception intellectually inclined people bhakti devotion inferior jñāna knowledge they disdainful towards people engaged devotion they look upon consider superior engaged brainy act acquiring knowledge whereas shree krishna declares jñānī spends several lifetimes cultivating knowledge jñāna matures finally surrender god in fact true knowledge leads devotionlet us look example man walking beach he steps upon object sand finds golden ring he thinks artificial jewellery worth keeps pocket forgets after days remembers shows friend goldsmith he checks says this pure gold worth least the man feels thrilled found something precious wears every day a days pass uncle visits jeweller the uncle looks ring says the stone gold ring precious diamond where get it costs on hearing man overwhelmed could not believe uncle said his uncle understood said it seems believe i willing pay it now man feels elated lottery he loves diamondstudded gold ring much knows real valuethis example demonstrates direct relationship knowledge love when value ring perceived man less love also lesser knowledge value increased love joy got also kept increasing the ramayan states jāneṅ binu na hoi paratītī binu paratīti hoi nahiṅ prītī without knowledge not faith without faith love not grow similarly someone acquired true knowledge claims know brahman love him comes naturally else knowledge merely theoretical not feel love fosters devotionshree krishna says jñānīs spend several lifetimes seeking true knowledge knowledge matures true wisdom supreme lord surrender him however he not say jñānīs karmīs haṭhayogis ascetics etc he declares devotees exalted souls realized god surrendered him nevertheless noble souls rare

Material desires have shrouded their knowledge. Hence, they forget that the Supreme Lord is the source of all that exists, including these celestial gods. As a president of a country appoints his officers among different departments. Similarly, these celestial gods also occupy different positions in the working of God’s creation. They derive their powers from God; they are not independent of Him. They can bestow on their devotees only material things that are under their control. But cannot liberate anyone from the bondage of Maya or the cycle of birth and death because; they themselves are not liberated from this cycle. God alone has the power to do so. The celestial gods are also souls like us. However, they have attained these positions in the celestial abodes as a result of their pious deeds from previous lives. Once their account of pious deeds depletes, they have to return to earth. Hence, even the celestial gods are perishable; God alone is eternal.",shree krishna says people worship devatās celestial gods per prescribed rituals attain material gains material desires shrouded knowledge hence forget supreme lord source exists including celestial gods as president country appoints officers among different departments similarly celestial gods also occupy different positions working god creation they derive powers god not independent him they bestow devotees material things control but not liberate anyone bondage maya cycle birth death not liberated cycle god alone power the celestial gods also souls like us however attained positions celestial abodes result pious deeds previous lives once account pious deeds depletes return earth hence even celestial gods perishable god alone eternal
7,21,यो यो यां यां तनुं भक्त: श्रद्धयार्चितुमिच्छति | तस्य तस्याचलां श्रद्धां तामेव विदधाम्यहम् ॥21॥,"Whichever form (of a deity) any devotee wants to worship with faith, that very firm faith of his I strengthen.","We find countless devotees around us engaging in devotion toward the celestial gods, with unflinching faith and wonder, how people develop such high faith in the lower form of worship? In this verse, Shree Krishna answers this and says that He is the creator of the faith in the celestial gods as well. When He finds people worshiping the devatās for the fulfillment of their material desires, He helps them in their devotion and steadies their faith. The ability to create śhraddhā or faith is beyond the capacity of the celestial gods; it is the indwelling Paramātmā or the Supreme Soul who inspires faith in the hearts of the devotees.  Later in the Bhagavad Gita verse 15.15, He states, “I am seated in the hearts of all living beings, and from Me come memory, knowledge, as well as forgetfulness. I alone am to be known by all the Vedas, am the author of the Vedant, and the knower of the meaning of the Vedas.”Shree Krishna had earlier mentioned that those who are in true-knowledge engage in the highest and the most beneficial kind of śhraddhā that is to worship the Supreme Lord. Then one might ask, why the Supreme Lord creates faith in people toward the celestial gods—is it not inappropriate?Let us look at this example of parents giving dolls to their small children. The child plays with these dolls as if they were real people and develops love and affection towards them. The parents are aware of the child’s innocence, yet they encourage this play to help the child develop the qualities of love, care, and affection towards other people. These qualities will help children become socially responsible when they grow up.Similarly, our eternal parent God is aware of our ignorance. Hence, when He finds that some souls engage in worship of the celestial gods for material gains, He helps them by steading their faith. He is aware that this experience will help in the evolution of the soul, and once they acquire true-knowledge that the Supreme Lord is the summum bonum or the highest good of everything, they will surrender to Him.",we find countless devotees around us engaging devotion toward celestial gods unflinching faith wonder people develop high faith lower form worship in verse shree krishna answers says he creator faith celestial gods well when he finds people worshiping devatās fulfillment material desires he helps devotion steadies faith the ability create śhraddhā faith beyond capacity celestial gods indwelling paramātmā supreme soul inspires faith hearts devotees later bhagavad gita verse he states i seated hearts living beings me come memory knowledge well forgetfulness i alone known vedas author vedant knower meaning vedas shree krishna earlier mentioned trueknowledge engage highest beneficial kind śhraddhā worship supreme lord then one might ask supreme lord creates faith people toward celestial not inappropriate let us look example parents giving dolls small children the child plays dolls real people develops love affection towards the parents aware child innocence yet encourage play help child develop qualities love care affection towards people these qualities help children become socially responsible grow upsimilarly eternal parent god aware ignorance hence he finds souls engage worship celestial gods material gains he helps steading faith he aware experience help evolution soul acquire trueknowledge supreme lord summum bonum highest good everything surrender him
7,22,स तया श्रद्धया युक्तस्तस्याराधनमीहते | लभते च तत: कामान्मयैव विहितान्हि तान् ॥22॥,"Being imbued with that faith, that person engages in worshipping that form, and he gets those very desired results therefrom as they are dispensed by Me alone.","Shree Krishna reiterates in this verse that the celestial gods do not have the capacity to fulfill the material desires of their devotees. They can only grant wishes if God permits it. Labhate means “to obtain.” The devotees with mediocre understanding may think that they have obtained their desired material objects by pleasing the devatās (celestial gods). However, it is not the devatās, but God who facilitates everything.",shree krishna reiterates verse celestial gods not capacity fulfill material desires devotees they grant wishes god permits labhate means obtain the devotees mediocre understanding may think obtained desired material objects pleasing devatās celestial gods however not devatās god facilitates everything

My devotees go to Me alone.,"Continuing from the previous verses, Shree Krishna explains to Arjun the spiritual principle that is: “One attains the object of one’s worship. People who worship the devatās go to the planets of the respective devatās upon death. Whereas, those who are devoted to me come to my abode.”  Now, the question comes up again, when reaching God is the ultimate destination, then why does God steady the faith of those devotees who worship the celestial gods?Consider the example of our education system, where students start with primary school but cannot stay at that level forever. The teachers encourage them and coach them to move to the next level. Even though primary school is necessary, students outgrow that and keep moving higher and higher. Similarly, the Bhagavad Gita is not for the primary school students or the novices who wish to attain the celestial abodes. But for those devotees who are seeking a higher purpose.Since the devatās are perishable, the fruits they bestow on their devotees are also perishable. However, God is imperishable, and the fruits of his worship are also ever-lasting. Those who worship the eternal form of God, upon death, attain His eternal abode and stay there forever in His service.",continuing previous verses shree krishna explains arjun spiritual principle one attains object one worship people worship devatās go planets respective devatās upon death whereas devoted come abode now question comes reaching god ultimate destination god steady faith devotees worship celestial gods consider example education system students start primary school not stay level forever the teachers encourage coach move next level even though primary school necessary students outgrow keep moving higher higher similarly bhagavad gita not primary school students novices wish attain celestial abodes but devotees seeking higher purposesince devatās perishable fruits bestow devotees also perishable however god imperishable fruits worship also everlasting those worship eternal form god upon death attain his eternal abode stay forever his service
7,24,अव्यक्तं व्यक्तिमापन्नं मन्यन्ते मामबुद्धय: | परं भावमजानन्तो ममाव्ययमनुत्तमम् ॥24॥,"The unintelligent, unaware of My supreme state which is immutable and unsurpassable, think of Me as the unmanifest that has become manifest.","People often vehemently debate upon the Supreme Lord being a formless God, while the others claim He exists in His personal-form. Even those who agree to both aspects of God’s personality are sometimes confused. Which of them precedes the other, and which of them is the original God? Did the personal form of God manifest from the formless, or is it the other way round? We have discussed this earlier in the commentary for Verse 4.5.Here in this verse, Shree Krishna resolves this debate by stating that God exists in the spiritual realm eternally in His divine form. The ignorant do not understand the magnificent and imperishable nature of His personal-form. The divine personality of God has not manifested from the formless Brahman; it is primordial. The divine light that emanates from His transcendental body is the formless Brahman.The Padma Purāṇ states:yannakhenduruchir brahma dhyeyaṁ brahmādibhiḥ suraiḥguṇatrayamatītaṁ taṁ vande vṛindāvaneśhvaram(Patal Khand 77.60) [v21]“The light that emanates from the toenails of God’s personality is worshipped as the Brahman by the jñānīs.”Therefore, there is no difference between the two forms. Neither of them is superior or inferior. In God’s personal-form, His name, form, virtues, abode, pastimes, associates, etc., manifest as an extension of His divine energy. However, in the formless Brahman, even though all the divine potencies and energies exist, they are in a concealed form.",people often vehemently debate upon supreme lord formless god others claim he exists his personalform even agree aspects god personality sometimes confused which precedes original god did personal form god manifest formless way round we discussed earlier commentary verse verse shree krishna resolves debate stating god exists spiritual realm eternally his divine form the ignorant not understand magnificent imperishable nature his personalform the divine personality god not manifested formless brahman primordial the divine light emanates his transcendental body formless brahmanthe padma purāṇ states yannakhenduruchir brahma dhyeyaṁ brahmādibhiḥ suraiḥguṇatrayamatītaṁ taṁ vande vṛindāvaneśhvaram patal khand the light emanates toenails god personality worshipped brahman jñānīs therefore difference two forms neither superior inferior in god personalform his name form virtues abode pastimes associates etc manifest extension his divine energy however formless brahman even though divine potencies energies exist concealed form
7,25,नाहं प्रकाश: सर्वस्य योगमायासमावृत: | मूढोऽयं नाभिजानाति लोको मामजमव्ययम् ॥25॥,"Being enveloped by yoga-maya, I do not become manifest to all. This deluded world does not know Me who am birthless and undecaying.","Shree Krishna had mentioned two of His divine energies earlier in this chapter, in verses 7.4 and 7.5. The eight-fold prakṛiti, or the material energy, and the jīva śhakti, or the soul energy. Now, He talks about His third and the most powerful energy that is the Yogmaya.  The Viṣhṇu Purāṇ states:viṣhṇu śhaktiḥ parā proktā kṣhetrajñākhyā tathā ’parāavidyā karma saṁjñānyā tṛitīyā śhaktiriṣhyate(6.7.61) [v22]“The Supreme Lord Shree Vishnu has three main energies—Yogmaya, the souls, and Maya.”Jagadguru Kripaluji Maharaj states:śhaktimān kī śhaktiyāñ, aganita yadapi bakhānatin mahañ ‘māyā, ‘jīva, aru, ‘parā, triśhakti pradhāna(Bhakti Śhatak verse 3) [v23]“The Supreme Energetic Shree Krishna has infinite energies. Amongst these, Yogmaya, the souls, and Maya are the main ones.”God descends in this world by virtue of His Yogmaya energy and reveals His divine pastimes, His divine abode, His divine bliss and love on the Earth plane. However, the same Yogmaya power keeps His divinity veiled from us. We are unable to feel His presence, although He is seated in our hearts. Even in the present, if we are fortunate enough to see the Lord in His personal-form, we cannot recognize Him. Until we are eligible for His divine vision, the Yogmaya keeps God’s divine form concealed from us. And only by God’s grace, the Yogmaya bestows upon us the divine vision that allows us to recognize and see God.The Ramayan states:chidānandamaya deha tumhārī, bigata bikāra jāna adhikārī  [v24]“O God, you have a divine form. Only those whose hearts are purified can know you by your grace.”Similar to God, His Yogmaya energy is both formless and manifests into personal forms. Radha, Sita, Lakshmi, Parvati. Durga, Kali, etc., are the divine forms of the Yogmaya energy of God. In the Vedic culture, all these forms are revered; as the Mother of the Universe. She radiates the motherly qualities of kindness, mercy, compassion, beauty, divine grace, and causeless love. Among these, the most important quality for us souls is Her divine grace with which we can acquire transcendental knowledge to know God. It is for the same reason, the devotees of Vrindavan sing, “Radhe Radhe, Shyam se milā de,” “O Radha, please bestow your grace and help me meet Shree Krishna.”Therefore, the same Yogmaya–conceals God from the unqualified souls and bestows Her divine grace upon the surrendered souls, for they can know Him. However, those souls who are under the influence of Maya or the material energy turn their backs towards God. They remain bereft of the divine grace of His Yogmaya energy and continue living in ignorance, entangled in Maya. Others who have turned to God are in the shelter of Yogmaya and liberated from Maya.",shree krishna mentioned two his divine energies earlier chapter verses the eightfold prakṛiti material energy jīva śhakti soul energy now he talks his third powerful energy yogmaya the viṣhṇu purāṇ states viṣhṇu śhaktiḥ parā proktā kṣhetrajñākhyā tathā parāavidyā karma saṁjñānyā tṛitīyā śhaktiriṣhyate the supreme lord shree vishnu three main souls maya jagadguru kripaluji maharaj states śhaktimān kī śhaktiyāñ aganita yadapi bakhānatin mahañ māyā jīva aru parā triśhakti pradhāna bhakti śhatak verse the supreme energetic shree krishna infinite energies amongst yogmaya souls maya main ones god descends world virtue his yogmaya energy reveals his divine pastimes his divine abode his divine bliss love earth plane however yogmaya power keeps his divinity veiled us we unable feel his presence although he seated hearts even present fortunate enough see lord his personalform not recognize him until eligible his divine vision yogmaya keeps god divine form concealed us and god grace yogmaya bestows upon us divine vision allows us recognize see godthe ramayan states chidānandamaya deha tumhārī bigata bikāra jāna adhikārī o god divine form only whose hearts purified know grace similar god his yogmaya energy formless manifests personal forms radha sita lakshmi parvati durga kali etc divine forms yogmaya energy god in vedic culture forms revered mother universe she radiates motherly qualities kindness mercy compassion beauty divine grace causeless love among important quality us souls her divine grace acquire transcendental knowledge know god it reason devotees vrindavan sing radhe radhe shyam se milā de o radha please bestow grace help meet shree krishna therefore god unqualified souls bestows her divine grace upon surrendered souls know him however souls influence maya material energy turn backs towards god they remain bereft divine grace his yogmaya energy continue living ignorance entangled maya others turned god shelter yogmaya liberated maya
7,26,वेदाहं समतीतानि वर्तमानानि चार्जुन | भविष्याणि च भूतानि मां तु वेद न कश्चन ॥26॥,"O Arjuna, I know the past and the present as also the future beings; but no one knows Me!","In this verse, God declares that He is trikāl-darśhī—knower of the past, present, and the future. Most of us are forgetful of even what we were thinking a few hours ago; whereas, God is omniscient. He remembers and keeps a record of the deeds, words, and even the thoughts of each individual soul of the universe throughout their life and since their infinite lifetimes. God maintains this record of the sañchit karma or the stockpile of karmas of every soul for endless lifetimes because, as the governor of the law of karma, He dispenses justice to the souls.Shree Krishna says that He has the knowledge of everything, the past, present, and the future. However, with our finite intellect, we cannot know the Almighty God. His infinite glory, splendor, energies, qualities, and extent are beyond the comprehension of our inadequate intellect.The Vedic scriptures state:yaḥ sarvajñaḥ sarvavidyasya jñānamayaṁ tapaḥ  (Muṇḍakopaniṣhad 1.1.9) [v25]“God is all-knowing and omniscient. His austerity consists of knowledge.”naiṣhā tarkeṇa matirāpaneyā  (Kaṭhopaniṣhad 1.2.9) [v26]“God is beyond the scope of our intellectual logic.”yato vācho nivartante aprāpya manasā saha  (Taittirīya Upaniṣhad 2.9.1) [v27]“God cannot be described in words, nor can our mind comprehend Him.”rām atarkya buddhi mana bānī, mata hamāra asa sunahi sayānī  (Ramayan) [v28]“God cannot be analyzed by arguments or formulated by words, mind, and intellect.”Only God knows Himself. However, if He finds some eligible soul, He bestows His grace upon that fortunate soul, and then with God’s divine intellect, the soul gets to know God. Therefore, only by God’s grace one can know God. Our material intellect does not have the capacity to know Him otherwise. The concept of God’s grace is discussed again in detail in 10.11 and 18.56.",in verse god declares he past present future most us forgetful even thinking hours ago whereas god omniscient he remembers keeps record deeds words even thoughts individual soul universe throughout life since infinite lifetimes god maintains record sañchit karma stockpile karmas every soul endless lifetimes governor law karma he dispenses justice soulsshree krishna says he knowledge everything past present future however finite intellect not know almighty god his infinite glory splendor energies qualities extent beyond comprehension inadequate intellectthe vedic scriptures state yaḥ sarvajñaḥ sarvavidyasya jñānamayaṁ tapaḥ muṇḍakopaniṣhad god allknowing omniscient his austerity consists knowledge naiṣhā tarkeṇa matirāpaneyā kaṭhopaniṣhad god beyond scope intellectual logic yato vācho nivartante aprāpya manasā saha taittirīya upaniṣhad god not described words mind comprehend him rām atarkya buddhi mana bānī mata hamāra asa sunahi sayānī ramayan god not analyzed arguments formulated words mind intellect only god knows himself however he finds eligible soul he bestows his grace upon fortunate soul god divine intellect soul gets know god therefore god grace one know god our material intellect not capacity know him otherwise the concept god grace discussed detail
7,27,इच्छाद्वेषसमुत्थेन द्वन्द्वमोहेन भारत | सर्वभूतानि सम्मोहं सर्गे यान्ति परन्तप ॥27॥,"O scion of the Bharata dynasty, O destroyer of foes, due to the delusion of duality arising from likes and dislikes, all creatures become bewildered at the time of their birth.","Having given a glimpse of His omniscience in the previous verse, Shree Krishna now goes back to a subject He had covered earlier about the dualities in the world. Happiness and distress, pleasure and pain, summer and winter, night and day, etc., all these dualities exist in pairs. These dualities are an inseparable part of life’s experiences. However, the most deluding dualities in life are birth and death. The arena of one’s life exists between the two ends of birth and death. From the very moment a living creature is born, death is inevitable, and again comes a subsequent-birth.Our material intellect believes that worldly pleasures will give us happiness and fulfillment. Therefore, in material consciousness, while we desire the favorable ones, we detest the unpleasant experiences. Although attraction and aversion are not the inherent qualities of these dualities, they develop due to our ignorance.

However, adversities have the potential of dispelling that material illusion from our mind and elevate our soul. Our ignorance is the root cause of our delusions.

They neither seek pleasure in the material world nor feel an aversion for pain. They are cautious while indulging in worldly pleasures as it may again delude their soul.

[They know Brahman as being all the individual entities and all actions. This verse prescribes meditation on the qualified Brahman for aspirants of the middle class. Verses beginning with the 14th speak about the realization of the unqualified Brahman by aspirants of the highest class.]","Shree Krishna had mentioned earlier in verse 7.26 that no one can know God by the strength of their own intellect. However, in this verse, He says that God can be known—only by virtue of His grace. Those devotees who surrender to Him completely—receive His divine grace. The Kaṭhopaniṣhad states:nāyamātmā pravachanena labhyo  na medhayā na bahunā śhrutenayamevaiṣha vṛiṇute tena labhya-stasyaiṣha ātmā vivṛiṇute tanūṁ svām(1.2.23) [v29]“God cannot be known—through spiritual discourses nor the intellect nor hearing various kinds of teachings. Only when He bestows His grace upon someone does that fortunate soul come to know Him.”The Vedas state:                    ekasmin vijñāte sarvamidaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati   [v30]“If you know God, you will know everything.”Although some spiritual seekers consider ātma-jñāna, or knowledge of the self, as the ultimate goal of human birth, it is only a tiny drop in the ocean of knowledge, which is brahma-jñāna or the knowledge of God. By just knowing a drop, one cannot understand the enormity, depth, or prowess of the ocean. Therefore, ātma-jñāna cannot be in any way equal to brahma-jñāna. However, it can be a starting point toward the absolute.According to the Vedas, absolute knowledge is—the Knowledge of God. If you know God, everything related to Him; is also revealed, and all your ignorance disappears. Shree Krishna states that those who take His shelter are liberated from the cycle of birth and death forever. And by His divine grace, they receive brahma-jñāna or knowledge of the Brahman, ātma-jñāna or knowledge of the self and the entire field of karmic action or the divine laws of karma.",shree krishna mentioned earlier verse one know god strength intellect however verse he says god virtue his grace those devotees surrender him his divine grace the kaṭhopaniṣhad states nāyamātmā pravachanena labhyo na medhayā na bahunā śhrutenayamevaiṣha vṛiṇute tena labhyastasyaiṣha ātmā vivṛiṇute tanūṁ svām god not spiritual discourses intellect hearing various kinds teachings only he bestows his grace upon someone fortunate soul come know him the vedas state ekasmin vijñāte sarvamidaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati if know god know everything although spiritual seekers consider ātmajñāna knowledge self ultimate goal human birth tiny drop ocean knowledge brahmajñāna knowledge god by knowing drop one not understand enormity depth prowess ocean therefore ātmajñāna not way equal brahmajñāna however starting point toward absoluteaccording vedas absolute knowledge knowledge god if know god everything related him also revealed ignorance disappears shree krishna states take his shelter liberated cycle birth death forever and his divine grace receive brahmajñāna knowledge brahman ātmajñāna knowledge self entire field karmic action divine laws karma

Such true devotees attain His divine abode. But how can one remember God even at the time of death? Death is said to be a very painful journey, comparable to 2000 scorpions biting at the same time.

Where is the question of remembering God?

In this verse, Shree Krishna says to Arjun that the Supreme Entity is called the Brahman. Time, space, the chain of cause and effect, etc., are all characteristics of the material realm. However, the Brahman is beyond these, as He is transcendental to the material plane. He is described as aksharam or indestructible because He is unaffected by the changes in the universe. The Brihadaranyak Upanishad 3.8.8 states, “Learned people speak of Brahman as akshar (indestructible).  It is also designated as Param (Supreme) because It possesses qualities beyond those possessed by maya and the souls.”The word adhyatma has two meanings in Sanskrit. One is the science of the soul, and the second is the path to spirituality. However, here Shree Krishna has used it for one’s own self that includes the body, mind, and intellect.Karmas are fruitive activities performed by a person. It is these karmas that forge every individual’s distinct conditions of existence in various lifetimes.

This ever-changing universe is called adhibhuta. Although the devatas or the celestial gods administer the different departments of the universe, God has sovereignty, even over the devatas. He is Virāṭ Purusha, the complete cosmic personality who encompasses the entire material creation. Hence, God is called Adhidaiva. Shree Krishna says that as the Supreme Soul or Paramatma, He dwells in the hearts of all living beings of the universe. He is the one who bestows rewards for all our actions and the presiding divinity for all the yajna (sacrifices). Thus, He is also called Adhiyajna, or the Lord of all sacrifices.

There is no doubt about this.","Shree Krishna declares in this verse that, whoever remembers Him at the time of death, attains Him and becomes God-like in character. He uses the words mad bhāvaṁ, which means “godlike nature.”  Therefore, one can achieve the cherished goal of God-realization by consciously absorbing one’s mind in the transcendental Names, Forms, Virtues, Pastimes, and Abodes of God, even at the time of death.It is one’s state of consciousness and the object of their absorption at the time of death; that determines their next birth. Shree Krishna will explain this principle in the next verse.",shree krishna declares verse whoever remembers him time death attains him becomes godlike character he uses words mad bhāvaṁ means godlike nature therefore one achieve cherished goal godrealization consciously absorbing one mind transcendental names forms virtues pastimes abodes god even time deathit one state consciousness object absorption time death determines next birth shree krishna explain principle next verse
8,6,यं यं वापि स्मरन्भावं त्यजत्यन्ते कलेवरम् | तं तमेवैति कौन्तेय सदा तद्भावभावित: ॥6॥,"O son of Kunti, thinking of any entity whichever it may be one gives up the body at the end, he attains that very one, having been always engrossed in its thought.","Shree Krishna states in this verse, whatever thoughts prominently dominate a person’s mind at the moment of death determine his or her next birth. However, one should not conclude that God-realization can be attained merely by meditating upon God at the time of death. When we plan our travel, it requires careful planning and execution beforehand; we cannot make our plans after we pack our baggage.For example, with a lot of effort, one may teach their pet parrot to say “Hello” or “Have a good day.” However, if someone attacks the parrot, it forgets all that it has learnt, and screeches in its natural sound of “Te-Te.” Likewise, the channels of thoughts that we create through lifelong habit, at the time of death, the same thoughts will naturally flow into our mind. What we constantly contemplate and meditate upon throughout our life are influenced by our daily habits and associations. Therefore, it is natural that these would continue to determine our final thoughts.The Puranas tell a story of an illustrious King Bharat. He renounced his kingdom to pursue God-realization and was living an ascetics life in the forest. Once, he was meditating and saw a deer jump into a nearby river. She was pregnant and escaping an attacking tiger. Out of fear, she delivered the baby in the flowing water. She had no chance to rescue her new-born and crossed over to the other side of the river. Witnessing this entire episode, Bharat felt pity for the baby deer that was floating in the river. He rescued the fawn and took it to his hut. He started raising it with great affection. Collecting green grass and feeding it, keeping it warm by hugging it, and watching its frolicking, gave Bharat a lot of pleasure.Slowly, Bharat spent his entire day taking care of the fawn. His mind became totally absorbed in its thoughts and away from God. Thus, even when he was about to die, he was only concerned about the fawn and called out to it in fond remembrance. As a result, King Bharat was born as a deer in his next life. Nevertheless, because of his spiritual sadhana from his previous lives, even in a deer’s body, he was aware of the mistakes he had committed in his past life. Hence even as a deer, Bharat spent his entire life near pious ashrams of saints in the forest. And when he died, he was granted human birth again. This time, Bharat did not waste his chance and completed his sadhana. Eventually, he attained God-realization and came to be known as the great sage Jadabharat.Death is a very painful experience. Therefore, it is natural that the mind gravitates toward those thoughts that are part of one’s inherent nature. According to the Skand Puran, thinking of God at the moment of death is exceedingly difficult. Hence, for the mind to always think of God requires our inner nature to be one with Him. The consciousness that abides within our mind and intellect is our inner nature. And whatever thoughts we contemplate continuously manifest as part of our inner nature. Therefore, we must practice remembering God at every moment of our life. Only then will we develop a God-conscious inner nature. In the next verse, Lord Krishna advises the same to Arjun.",shree krishna states verse whatever thoughts prominently dominate person mind moment death determine next birth however one not conclude godrealization attained merely meditating upon god time death when plan travel requires careful planning execution beforehand not make plans pack baggagefor example lot effort one may teach pet parrot say hello have good day however someone attacks parrot forgets learnt screeches natural sound tete likewise channels thoughts create lifelong habit time death thoughts naturally flow mind what constantly contemplate meditate upon throughout life influenced daily habits associations therefore natural would continue determine final thoughtsthe puranas tell story illustrious king bharat he renounced kingdom pursue godrealization living ascetics life forest once meditating saw deer jump nearby river she pregnant escaping attacking tiger out fear delivered baby flowing water she chance rescue newborn crossed side river witnessing entire episode bharat felt pity baby deer floating river he rescued fawn took hut he started raising great affection collecting green grass feeding keeping warm hugging watching frolicking gave bharat lot pleasureslowly bharat spent entire day taking care fawn his mind became totally absorbed thoughts away god thus even die concerned fawn called fond remembrance as result king bharat born deer next life nevertheless spiritual sadhana previous lives even deer body aware mistakes committed past life hence even deer bharat spent entire life near pious ashrams saints forest and died granted human birth this time bharat not waste chance completed sadhana eventually attained godrealization came known great sage jadabharatdeath painful experience therefore natural mind gravitates toward thoughts part one inherent nature according skand puran thinking god moment death exceedingly difficult hence mind always think god requires inner nature one him the consciousness abides within mind intellect inner nature and whatever thoughts contemplate continuously manifest part inner nature therefore must practice remembering god every moment life only develop godconscious inner nature in next verse lord krishna advises arjun
8,7,तस्मात्सर्वेषु कालेषु मामनुस्मर युध्य च | मय्यर्पितमनोबुद्धिर्मामेवैष्यस्यसंशयम् ॥7॥,"Therefore, think of Me at all times and fight. There is no doubt that by dedicating your mind and intellect to Me, you will attain Me alone.","The essence of the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita is in the first line of this verse. It has the power to make your life divine. It reiterates the definition of karma yoga and applies to people from all walks of life. Shree Krishna says to Arjun, “Do your duty with your body, and keep your mind attached to Me.” As a warrior, Arjun must fight; that is his duty. However, the Lord says to Arjun that even in the middle of a battle, one should remember God. The same message is for everyone—be it farmers, engineers, doctors, students, homemakers, or any other professional. People often disregard their worldly duties and responsibilities with the pretext of leading a spiritual life. On the other hand, some give an excuse of their worldly engagements for not practicing spirituality. They perceive that both material and spiritual goals; cannot be pursued concurrently. But Shree Krishna’s message in this verse defies all these myths and can sanctify our entire life.In the practice of karma yoga, the body is engaged in worldly work, but the mind is attached to God. Hence, while we work to fulfil our worldly duties, these works are not bound by the Law of Karma. Works; that are performed with attachment result in karmic reactions. In the absence of attachment, one is not considered guilty even in the worldly laws.Let us take an example of a man apprehended for killing a pedestrian in a road accident. In the court, when the judge questioned him if he killed the pedestrian, the man agreed. The judge said, “Then you are guilty of murder and will get punished accordingly.” To this, the man said, “Sir, I agree I killed the pedestrian, but I had no intention to kill, it was an accident.” He further explained, “Your honour, I was driving on the appropriate side of the road, the lights were green, and my car was within the speed limits. I was alert, and my car was also in perfect condition. However, this man came suddenly in front of my car, although I applied the brakes, my car hit him, and he died immediately.” On hearing this, the judge let him off without any punishment, as it was established that the incident was an accident and this man had no intention to kill.The above example illustrates that even in the material world, one is not held liable for actions taken without attachment to results. Similarly, in the spiritual world, the Law of Karma holds the same principle.In the Mahabharat war, Arjun fulfiled his duties as a warrior. He fought valiantly without any attachments to worldly gain. He followed Shree Krishna’s instructions and kept his mind constantly attached to God. Therefore, at the end of the war, Shree Krishna declared that Arjun had not accrued any bad karma. As per the Law of Karma: when someone performs their duties without any selfish attachment to the world, with their mind always in God, such actions get multiplied by zero. When you multiply even a million with zero, the result will always be a zero.This verse clearly defines the condition for karma yoga: Do your worldly duties, but your mind should always be thinking of God. The very instant we forget God, our mind is taken over by the mighty commanders of maya’s army—desire, envy, greed, lust, anger, hatred, etc. Therefore, it is necessary that we keep our mind always attached to God.Some people claim to be karma yogis because they practice both karma and yoga. Every day they do their worldly duties, which they call their karma, and a few minutes of yoga, by meditating on God. However, this is not the definition of karma yoga given by Lord Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita. He says that in karma yoga, there are only two conditions:1) While doing any work, the mind should always be thinking of God.2) The remembrance of God should be constant throughout the day and not intermittent.This famous couplet by Saint Kabir beautifully expresses this concept:sumiran kī sudhi yoṅ karo, jyauṅ gāgar panihārabolat dolat surati meṅ, kahe kabīra vichār“Remember God just as the village woman remembers the water pot on her head. She speaks with others and walks on the path, but her hand keeps holding onto the pot.”In the next verse, Shree Krishna explains the benefits of practicing karma yoga.",the essence teachings bhagavad gita first line verse it power make life divine it reiterates definition karma yoga applies people walks life shree krishna says arjun do duty body keep mind attached me as warrior arjun must fight duty however lord says arjun even middle battle one remember god the message farmers engineers doctors students homemakers professional people often disregard worldly duties responsibilities pretext leading spiritual life on hand give excuse worldly engagements not practicing spirituality they perceive material spiritual goals not pursued concurrently but shree krishna message verse defies myths sanctify entire lifein practice karma yoga body engaged worldly work mind attached god hence work fulfil worldly duties works not bound law karma works performed attachment result karmic reactions in absence attachment one not considered guilty even worldly lawslet us take example man apprehended killing pedestrian road accident in court judge questioned killed pedestrian man agreed the judge said then guilty murder get punished accordingly to man said sir i agree i killed pedestrian i intention kill accident he explained your honour i driving appropriate side road lights green car within speed limits i alert car also perfect condition however man came suddenly front car although i applied brakes car hit died immediately on hearing judge let without punishment established incident accident man intention killthe example illustrates even material world one not held liable actions taken without attachment results similarly spiritual world law karma holds principlein mahabharat war arjun fulfiled duties warrior he fought valiantly without attachments worldly gain he followed shree krishna instructions kept mind constantly attached god therefore end war shree krishna declared arjun not accrued bad karma as per law karma someone performs duties without selfish attachment world mind always god actions get multiplied zero when multiply even million zero result always zerothis verse clearly defines condition karma yoga do worldly duties mind always thinking god the instant forget god mind taken mighty commanders maya envy greed lust anger hatred etc therefore necessary keep mind always attached godsome people claim karma yogis practice karma yoga every day worldly duties call karma minutes yoga meditating god however not definition karma yoga given lord krishna bhagavad gita he says karma yoga two while work mind always thinking the remembrance god constant throughout day not intermittentthis famous couplet saint kabir beautifully expresses concept sumiran kī sudhi yoṅ karo jyauṅ gāgar panihārabolat dolat surati meṅ kahe kabīra vichār remember god village woman remembers water pot head she speaks others walks path hand keeps holding onto pot in next verse shree krishna explains benefits practicing karma yoga
8,8,अभ्यासयोगयुक्तेन चेतसा नान्यगामिना | परमं पुरुषं दिव्यं याति पार्थानुचिन्तयन् ॥8॥,"O son of Prtha, by meditating with a mind which is engaged in the yoga of practice and which does not stray away to anything else, one reaches the supreme Person existing in the effulgent region.","Lord Krishna has reiterated this instruction to always engage the mind in meditating upon God several times in the Bhagavad Gita itself. Verses 8.14, 10.10, 12.8, etc., emphasize the same concept.In this verse, Shree Krishna uses the word abhyāsa, which means to practice. He says that we must train our mind and form a habit of always meditating upon God. This practice is not to be done at fixed times or regular intervals but continuously as part of our daily life alongside our worldly activities throughout the day.We must remember that it is not the actions that we are performing with our body but where we are placing our mind that will shape our future. While performing our worldly duties, if we attach our mind to God, who is all pure, our mind will also get purified.When one is continuously engaging in devotion, with complete surrender to God, their purified mind will gradually get fully absorbed in God-consciousness. Such souls receive the divine grace of God that liberates them from the bondage of maya. Then God bestows upon these souls His unlimited divine bliss, divine knowledge, and divine love. They become God-realized while they are still alive and live a complete life. Eventually, when they die, their soul ascends to the Divine Abode of God.",lord krishna reiterated instruction always engage mind meditating upon god several times bhagavad gita verses etc emphasize conceptin verse shree krishna uses word abhyāsa means practice he says must train mind form habit always meditating upon god this practice not done fixed times regular intervals continuously part daily life alongside worldly activities throughout daywe must remember not actions performing body placing mind shape future while performing worldly duties attach mind god pure mind also get purifiedwhen one continuously engaging devotion complete surrender god purified mind gradually get fully absorbed godconsciousness such souls receive divine grace god liberates bondage maya then god bestows upon souls his unlimited divine bliss divine knowledge divine love they become godrealized still alive live complete life eventually die soul ascends divine abode god
8,9,कविं पुराणमनुशासितार मणोरणीयांसमनुस्मरेद्य: | सर्वस्य धातारमचिन्त्यरूप मादित्यवर्णं तमस: परस्तात् ॥9॥,"He who meditates on the Omniscient, the Ancient, the Ruler, subtler than the subtle, the Ordainer of everything, of inconceivable form, effulgent like the sun, and beyond darkness- (he attains the supreme Person).","We can meditate upon God in several ways. The Names, Forms, Leelas (Pastimes), Associates, and Abodes of God. There is no difference among all these aspects of God. Therefore, one can meditate on any one or all of them. Such meditation, where we attach our mind to the Supreme Divinity, takes our mind to the divine realm, and as a result, it purifies.In this verse, Shree Krishna has mentioned eight such divine aspects of God:1. Kavi: Like a poet who knows the entirety of his creation, God is omniscient. He is the seer who knows the past, present, and future, as mentioned in verse 7.26.2. Purāṇam:  God is the most ancient, and nothing predates Him. He is the origin of the entire material and spiritual world, but He has not originated from anything. God is without a beginning or an end.3. Anuśhāsitāram: God is the governor or the ruler. He administers His regime through the celestial gods that He has appointed or sometimes directly. He is the creator, and everything in this universe is under His control and run by His law.4. Aṇoraṇīyān: Here God is said to exist in the subtlest or subatomic form. The soul is subtler than matter, but God is even subtler than the soul, as He is seated within every soul.5. Sarvasya Dhātā: God is the source of sustenance. Similar to an ocean that sustains the waves and its vast marine ecology. God is the support for His entire creation.6. Achintya rūpa: God exists in inconceivable forms. Our mind and intellect are material in nature, and God is divine, thus, beyond our understanding. It is only through His grace one can understand Him. He bestows His divine grace and makes our mind divine by His Yogmaya power; only then can we know Him.7. Āditya varṇa:  Āditya is one of the names of the sun god. Here, God is said to be dazzling like the sun.8. Tamasaḥ Parastāt: Similar to the sun that eradicates darkness, God with His effulgence eliminates ignorance. On a cloudy day, the sun is not visible, but it is an optical illusion for us. The sun is where it is, unaffected by the clouds in the earth’s atmosphere. Similarly, during His Leelas or pastimes, God may seem to be covered by His material energy, Maya. However, He is unaffected by it.  He is beyond darkness and ignorance. One may ask, why so much variety. Western scholars often get confused by the various philosophies, paths, and instructions given in the Vedic scriptures. Therefore, it is stressed in the Hindu scriptures to study them under the guidance of an able Guru.We all have different choices and natures according to our sanskārs (tendencies) from endless lifetimes. Consider this example of two people going into a cloth shop. The chances of both of them buying the same type, color, or style of clothes is very rare. Therefore, the shops keep a variety of clothes and cater to the choices and preferences of people. Similarly, the Vedic scriptures also offer various spiritual paths so that based on the level of sadhana that we may have performed in our past lives, we may choose a suitable path. However, they simultaneously stress on bhakti or devotion to God that ties together all these paths in one common thread.The Bhagavad Gita beautifully embraces varieties of sadhanas to cater to a large populace belonging to diverse backgrounds, upbringing, and natures. Bhakti involves focusing the mind upon God, in His various divine Forms, Qualities, Pastimes, etc. In its pure form, bhakti is called śhuddha bhakti.

8,10,प्रयाणकाले मनसाचलेन भक्त्या युक्तो योगबलेन चैव | भ्रुवोर्मध्ये प्राणमावेश्य सम्यक् स तं परं पुरुषमुपैति दिव्यम् ॥10॥,"At the time of death, having fully fixed the Prana (vita force) between the eyebrows with an unswerving mind, and being imbued with devotion as also the strength of concentration, he reaches that resplendent supreme person.","We can meditate upon God in several ways. The Names, Forms, Leelas (Pastimes), Associates, and Abodes of God. There is no difference among all these aspects of God. Therefore, one can meditate on any one or all of them. Such meditation, where we attach our mind to the Supreme Divinity, takes our mind to the divine realm, and as a result, it purifies.In this verse, Shree Krishna has mentioned eight such divine aspects of God:1. Kavi: Like a poet who knows the entirety of his creation, God is omniscient. He is the seer who knows the past, present, and future, as mentioned in verse 7.26.2. Purāṇam:  God is the most ancient, and nothing predates Him. He is the origin of the entire material and spiritual world, but He has not originated from anything. God is without a beginning or an end.3. Anuśhāsitāram: God is the governor or the ruler. He administers His regime through the celestial gods that He has appointed or sometimes directly. He is the creator, and everything in this universe is under His control and run by His law.4. Aṇoraṇīyān: Here God is said to exist in the subtlest or subatomic form. The soul is subtler than matter, but God is even subtler than the soul, as He is seated within every soul.5. Sarvasya Dhātā: God is the source of sustenance. Similar to an ocean that sustains the waves and its vast marine ecology. God is the support for His entire creation.6. Achintya rūpa: God exists in inconceivable forms. Our mind and intellect are material in nature, and God is divine, thus, beyond our understanding. It is only through His grace one can understand Him. He bestows His divine grace and makes our mind divine by His Yogmaya power; only then can we know Him.7. Āditya varṇa:  Āditya is one of the names of the sun god. Here, God is said to be dazzling like the sun.8. Tamasaḥ Parastāt: Similar to the sun that eradicates darkness, God with His effulgence eliminates ignorance. On a cloudy day, the sun is not visible, but it is an optical illusion for us. The sun is where it is, unaffected by the clouds in the earth’s atmosphere. Similarly, during His Leelas or pastimes, God may seem to be covered by His material energy, Maya. However, He is unaffected by it.  He is beyond darkness and ignorance. One may ask, why so much variety. Western scholars often get confused by the various philosophies, paths, and instructions given in the Vedic scriptures. Therefore, it is stressed in the Hindu scriptures to study them under the guidance of an able Guru.We all have different choices and natures according to our sanskārs (tendencies) from endless lifetimes. Consider this example of two people going into a cloth shop. The chances of both of them buying the same type, color, or style of clothes is very rare. Therefore, the shops keep a variety of clothes and cater to the choices and preferences of people. Similarly, the Vedic scriptures also offer various spiritual paths so that based on the level of sadhana that we may have performed in our past lives, we may choose a suitable path. However, they simultaneously stress on bhakti or devotion to God that ties together all these paths in one common thread.The Bhagavad Gita beautifully embraces varieties of sadhanas to cater to a large populace belonging to diverse backgrounds, upbringing, and natures. Bhakti involves focusing the mind upon God, in His various divine Forms, Qualities, Pastimes, etc. In its pure form, bhakti is called śhuddha bhakti. However, when undertaken along with ashtanga yoga, it is termed yog-miśhra bhakti or a fusion of devotion and ashtanga yoga sadhana.Shree Krishna has described yog-miśhra bhakti from verse ten to thirteen. In the practice of ashtanga yoga, the life force or prān shakti is channelized through suṣhumṇā nādi of the spinal column and then raised toward the third eye region between the eyebrows.

The Bṛihadāraṇyak Upaniṣhad states:etasya vā akṣharasya praśhāsane gārgisūryāchandramasau vidhṛitau tiṣhṭhataḥ   (3.8.9)“Under the mighty control of the Imperishable, the sun and the moon are held on their course.”Shree Krishna mentions in this verse the word sangraheṇa, which means “in brief.” He says that this path is very difficult to follow and not suitable for everyone. Therefore, He will not elaborate much and briefly describe this path of yog-miśhrā bhakti; that leads to attaining the formless aspect of God. It demands living a life of rigid continence and perform severe austerities. Renouncing worldly desires and practicing brahmacharya, a vow of celibacy. As was previously detailed in verse 6.14, the practice of celibacy conserves a person’s physical energy. This energy, when channelized through sadhana, gets transformed into spiritual energy. It also enhances the intellect and memory power of the sādhaks (spiritual aspirants) and helps them comprehend the spiritual subjects better.",in vedas god referred many names brahman bhagwan deva paramātmā praṇa puruṣh sat etc in places referring his formless aspect god said akshar means imperishable the bṛihadāraṇyak upaniṣhad states etasya vā akṣharasya praśhāsane gārgisūryāchandramasau vidhṛitau tiṣhṭhataḥ under mighty control imperishable sun moon held course shree krishna mentions verse word sangraheṇa means brief he says path difficult follow not suitable everyone therefore he not elaborate much briefly describe path yogmiśhrā bhakti leads attaining formless aspect god it demands living life rigid continence perform severe austerities renouncing worldly desires practicing brahmacharya vow celibacy as previously detailed verse practice celibacy conserves person physical energy this energy channelized sadhana gets transformed spiritual energy it also enhances intellect memory power sādhaks spiritual aspirants helps comprehend spiritual subjects better
8,12,सर्वद्वाराणि संयम्य मनो हृदि निरुध्य च | मूर्ध्न्याधायात्मन: प्राणमास्थितो योगधारणाम् ॥12॥,"Having controlled all the passages, having confined the mind in the heart, and having fixed his own vital force in the head, (and then) continuing in the firmness in yoga;","It is through the senses and their objects the world enters our mind. When we see, hear, touch, taste, or smell an object of perception, it leaves an impression on our mind. Our mind then dwells upon these experiences, starts to contemplate, and creates repetitive thoughts that increase our attachment to the world. Therefore, a practitioner of meditation should guard himself against the incessant stream of worldly thoughts that the unrestrained senses can create. Locking the world out by restraining the mind and the senses; is most essential in meditation.In this verse, Shree Krishna uses the words sarva-dvārāṇi-sanyamya, which mean guarding the gates of the body, and hṛidi nirudhya that means “locking the mind in the heart.” He says that by controlling the passages that enter the body, one can lock the mind in the heart. Restricting the senses from their natural tendencies and directing the mind toward akṣharam the imperishable Supreme Lord. Then with complete attention and devotional feelings, one should meditate on Him. He ends the verse with yoga-dhāraṇām, which means “uniting the consciousness with God.”",it senses objects world enters mind when see hear touch taste smell object perception leaves impression mind our mind dwells upon experiences starts contemplate creates repetitive thoughts increase attachment world therefore practitioner meditation guard incessant stream worldly thoughts unrestrained senses create locking world restraining mind senses essential meditationin verse shree krishna uses words sarvadvārāṇisanyamya mean guarding gates body hṛidi nirudhya means locking mind heart he says controlling passages enter body one lock mind heart restricting senses natural tendencies directing mind toward akṣharam imperishable supreme lord then complete attention devotional feelings one meditate him he ends verse yogadhāraṇām means uniting consciousness god
8,13,ओमित्येकाक्षरं ब्रह्म व्याहरन्मामनुस्मरन् | य: प्रयाति त्यजन्देहं स याति परमां गतिम् ॥13॥,"He who departs by leaving the body while uttering the single syllable, viz Om, which is Brahman, and thinking of Me, he attains the supreme Goal.","The Vedic scriptures state that at the beginning of creation, God first created sound. With sound, He created space and then continued with the rest of the creation process.  That primordial sound was the sacred syllable OM it is also called Pranav—the sound manifestation of the Brahman. It represents the formless aspect of the Supreme Lord, without any attributes and virtues.The Bible also mentions this in John 1:1: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.The sound Om pervades the entire creation; it is imperishable and infinite like God Himself. Hence, it is also called anāhat nād. In the Vedic philosophy, it is conferred as the mahā vākya, or the Great Sound Vibration of the Vedas and often attached to the beginning of the Vedic mantras, as bīja (seed or core) mantra similar to hrīṁ, klīṁ, etc.For proper chanting of the sacred word OM, the emphasis is on the vibrations of three letters: A… U… M… One starts by making an “A” sound from the belly, with an open mouth and throat; it then merges into a “U” created in the middle of the mouth. Finally, it ends in chanting “M” with a closed mouth.Devotees consider the word Om as the impersonal form of God. In ashtanga yoga, the Praṇav sound is considered the object of meditation. In this verse, Shree Krishna is describing the process of meditation with regard to the ashtanga yoga sadhana. He states that to focus the mind on God, one should chant “Óm” while practicing austerities and maintaining the vow of celibacy.However, the devotees who take the path of bhakti yoga prefer to meditate upon the personal Names of the Lord. They experience greater sweetness in God’s bliss when they meditate on; the personal Name and Forms of God, such as Ram, Krishna, Shiv, etc.If you compare; the pleasure experienced by two ladies, one who is an expectant mother and one who has her new-born baby in her lap. The experience is much sweeter for the new mother. Seeing her beautiful baby, she even forgets the discomfort and pain she had experienced during childbirth.The time of death is the final test of our meditation. As death is said to be intensely painful and despite the pain, those who are able to focus on God even at that last moment; attain Him. And on leaving the body, their souls reach His divine abode. However, to achieve such a state is very difficult; it requires continuous practice throughout one’s life. The merciful Lord Krishna shows us an easier path in the next verse.",the vedic scriptures state beginning creation god first created sound with sound he created space continued rest creation process that primordial sound sacred syllable om also called sound manifestation brahman it represents formless aspect supreme lord without attributes virtuesthe bible also mentions john in beginning word word god word godthe sound om pervades entire creation imperishable infinite like god himself hence also called anāhat nād in vedic philosophy conferred mahā vākya great sound vibration vedas often attached beginning vedic mantras bīja seed core mantra similar hrīṁ klīṁ etcfor proper chanting sacred word om emphasis vibrations three letters one starts making a sound belly open mouth throat merges u created middle mouth finally ends chanting m closed mouthdevotees consider word om impersonal form god in ashtanga yoga praṇav sound considered object meditation in verse shree krishna describing process meditation regard ashtanga yoga sadhana he states focus mind god one chant óm practicing austerities maintaining vow celibacyhowever devotees take path bhakti yoga prefer meditate upon personal names lord they experience greater sweetness god bliss meditate personal name forms god ram krishna shiv etcif compare pleasure experienced two ladies one expectant mother one newborn baby lap the experience much sweeter new mother seeing beautiful baby even forgets discomfort pain experienced childbirththe time death final test meditation as death said intensely painful despite pain able focus god even last moment attain him and leaving body souls reach his divine abode however achieve state difficult requires continuous practice throughout one life the merciful lord krishna shows us easier path next verse
8,14,अनन्यचेता: सततं यो मां स्मरति नित्यश: | तस्याहं सुलभ: पार्थ नित्ययुक्तस्य योगिन: ॥14॥,"O son of Prtha, to that yogi of constant concentration and single-minded attention, who remembers Me uninterruptedly and for long, I am easy of attainment.","In the previous verse, Shree Krishna had explained the process of meditation as per ashtanga yoga sadhana to focus on the formless God, devoid of any attributes. However, this practice is not only difficult but also very bland. Therefore, He suggests an alternative method, that is, to meditate upon the personal forms of God such as Ram, Krishna, Shiv, Vishnu, etc., including their Names, Forms, Virtues, Pastimes, Abodes, and Associates. This method is simpler and helps in keeping the mind absorbed in God and His divine form.For the first time in the Bhagavad Geeta, Shree Krishna says that He is easy to attain. But only to those yogis who are ananya-chetāḥ, which means their mind is absorbed exclusively in God. The word a-nanya Etymologically means na anya, or “no other.” Thus, exclusive devotion is the precondition for attaining God. Throughout the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna has stressed upon exclusive devotion and surrender to attain Him.ananyāśh chintayanto māṁ   9.22tam eva śharaṇaṁ gachchha   18.62mām ekaṁ śharaṇaṁ vraja   18.66Other Vedic scriptures also reiterate the same message:mām ekam eva śharaṇam ātmānaṁ sarva-dehinām   (Bhagavatam 11.12.15)“Surrender to Me alone, who am the Supreme Soul of all living beings.”eka bharoso eka bala ek āsa visvāsa   (Ramayan)“I have only one support, one strength, one faith, one shelter, and that is Shree Ram.”anyāśhrayāṇāṁ tyāgo ’nanyatā   (Nārad Bhakti Darśhan, Sūtra 10)“Reject all other shelters, and become exclusive to God.”Many spiritual seekers love God and try hard to attain Him, but their mind is also attached to the material world, their family, friends, pets, house, assets, etc. They contemplate upon God to purify their mind, but when they go back to their worldly relations, it gets dirty again. The worldly attachments are not only binding but also imperfect, thus cause impurity of the mind. It is like applying soap to a dirty cloth, cleaning it with pure water, and putting it back into unclean water. Thus, all the effort goes futile.The ultimate aim of sadhana is to purify the mind, which can only be done by attaching the mind to God, who is all-pure. In this verse, Shree Krishna says that it is not just devotion; but exclusive devotion; that is necessary to attain Him. Exclusive devotion is attainable only when a purified mind is absorbed in the Names, Forms, Virtues, Pastimes, Abodes, and Associates of God.",in previous verse shree krishna explained process meditation per ashtanga yoga sadhana focus formless god devoid attributes however practice not difficult also bland therefore he suggests alternative method meditate upon personal forms god ram krishna shiv vishnu etc including names forms virtues pastimes abodes associates this method simpler helps keeping mind absorbed god his divine formfor first time bhagavad geeta shree krishna says he easy attain but yogis ananyachetāḥ means mind absorbed exclusively god the word ananya etymologically means na anya other thus exclusive devotion precondition attaining god throughout bhagavad gita lord krishna stressed upon exclusive devotion surrender attain himananyāśh chintayanto māṁ eva śharaṇaṁ gachchha ekaṁ śharaṇaṁ vraja vedic scriptures also reiterate message mām ekam eva śharaṇam ātmānaṁ sarvadehinām bhagavatam surrender me alone supreme soul living beings eka bharoso eka bala ek āsa visvāsa ramayan i one support one strength one faith one shelter shree ram anyāśhrayāṇāṁ tyāgo nanyatā nārad bhakti darśhan sūtra reject shelters become exclusive god many spiritual seekers love god try hard attain him mind also attached material world family friends pets house assets etc they contemplate upon god purify mind go back worldly relations gets dirty the worldly attachments not binding also imperfect thus cause impurity mind it like applying soap dirty cloth cleaning pure water putting back unclean water thus effort goes futilethe ultimate aim sadhana purify mind done attaching mind god allpure in verse shree krishna says not devotion exclusive devotion necessary attain him exclusive devotion attainable purified mind absorbed names forms virtues pastimes abodes associates god
8,15,मामुपेत्य पुनर्जन्म दु:खालयमशाश्वतम् | नाप्नुवन्ति महात्मान: संसिद्धिं परमां गता: ॥15॥,"As a result of reaching Me, the exalted ones who have attained the highest perfection do not get rebirth which is an abode of sorrows and which is impermanent.","What happens when one attains God? Once God-realized the soul is liberated from the cycle of life and death, it reaches the divine abode of God and remains there forever. It does not take birth in the material world again and suffer its miseries. Life in the material world from birth till death is full of suffering.The struggle starts inside the mother’s womb itself, where we hang upside down for nine months. Then we go through a painful process of taking birth and delivered into an unknown world, where we have to cry for our every need. As we grow, we need to learn to speak, eat, walk, etc. Then comes the turmoil of adolescence, which is a mentally challenging phase. As adults, marriage and relationships test our endurance and patience to accept and accommodate individualities. We struggle to maintain social responsibilities. Then comes old age with its gifts of sickness and disease. All through our life, we suffer from pain and miseries; induced by our own body, mind, people, or circumstances around us. Then finally, we die, which is again an extremely painful experience.But why does God put us through so much pain and misery? In God’s grand design, the purpose of these miseries is to realize that the material realm is not the permanent abode for the soul. It serves as a correction home for the souls who have forgotten God and are trapped in the material world. These sufferings and miseries help the souls develop the desire for God. Consider an example of a person who accidentally puts his hand on burning coal. Immediately, due to the burning sensation and pain he experiences, he withdraws his hand.What really happened here? When the man touched hot coal, his skin started burning, and the neurons on his skin sent a message to the brain of the pain he experienced. The brain immediately sends commands to his hand muscles that remove his hand to avoid further burning and pain. Therefore, pain is a signal that something is not right and needs correction. Similarly, the pain and miseries that we experience in the material world; are stimulation for us to shun our defective consciousness. These inspire and motivate the lost souls to tread toward their ultimate goal of union with God.Those worthy souls who commit themselves in exclusive devotion attain God and reach His Divine Abode. However, those souls who remain engrossed in material affluence and forget God continue to rotate in the cycle of birth and death. Eventually, we get what we make ourselves worthy of and the endeavours we choose to undertake.",what happens one attains god once godrealized soul liberated cycle life death reaches divine abode god remains forever it not take birth material world suffer miseries life material world birth till death full sufferingthe struggle starts inside mother womb hang upside nine months then go painful process taking birth delivered unknown world cry every need as grow need learn speak eat walk etc then comes turmoil adolescence mentally challenging phase as adults marriage relationships test endurance patience accept accommodate individualities we struggle maintain social responsibilities then comes old age gifts sickness disease all life suffer pain miseries induced body mind people circumstances around us then finally die extremely painful experiencebut god put us much pain misery in god grand design purpose miseries realize material realm not permanent abode soul it serves correction home souls forgotten god trapped material world these sufferings miseries help souls develop desire god consider example person accidentally puts hand burning coal immediately due burning sensation pain experiences withdraws handwhat really happened when man touched hot coal skin started burning neurons skin sent message brain pain experienced the brain immediately sends commands hand muscles remove hand avoid burning pain therefore pain signal something not right needs correction similarly pain miseries experience material world stimulation us shun defective consciousness these inspire motivate lost souls tread toward ultimate goal union godthose worthy souls commit exclusive devotion attain god reach his divine abode however souls remain engrossed material affluence forget god continue rotate cycle birth death eventually get make worthy endeavours choose undertake
8,16,आब्रह्मभुवनाल्लोका: पुनरावर्तिनोऽर्जुन | मामुपेत्य तु कौन्तेय पुनर्जन्म न विद्यते ॥16॥,"O Arjuna, all the worlds together with the world of Brahma are subject to return. But, O son of Kunti, there is no rebirth after reaching Me.","According to the Vedic scriptures, there are fourteen worlds in our universe. Seven planes of existence beginning with earth and higher —bhūḥ, bhuvaḥ, swaḥ, mahaḥ, janaḥ, tapaḥ, satyaḥ. The higher planes are the celestial abodes called the Swarga. The remaining seven planes that are lower than earth are the hellish abodes called narak. These are —tal, atal, vital, sutal, talātal, rasātal, pātāl. Similar references are made by other religions as well. Islam mentions the seventh sky or the sātvāñ āsmān as the highest of the seven heavens. The Talmud, the book of Jewish law and theology, has also enumerated seven heavens, the highest being Araboth.These fourteen planes of existence are called the lokas or various worlds of our universe. The satyaḥ lok, also known as Brahma Lok, the abode of Brahma is the highest among them, and pātāl lok is the lowest. However, all these lokas are under the realm of Maya, the material energy of God. Hence, the dwellers of all the fourteen lokas go through the cycle of birth and death. It is because of their impermanent nature Shree Krishna in the previous verse called these worlds to be aśhāśhvatam (temporary) and duḥkhālayam (full of misery).All those who are born in these lokas of material existence are subject to death someday. Even the king of the celestial gods, Indra, has to die.The Puranas mention an incident where Indra ordered the celestial architect, Vishwakarma, to construct a huge palace for himself in Swarga.  However, the extension plan kept on increasing, and the construction was not ending. Vishwakarma got weary and prayed to God for help. God visited Indra and enquired, “How many Vishwakarmas have you engaged in constructing such a huge palace?” Indra was surprised by God’s question because he thought there was only one Vishwakarma. Smiling, God said to Indra, “Similar to this universe with its fourteen worlds, there are infinite universes. And each universe has an Indra and a Vishwakarma”.At the same time, Indra saw several ants walking toward him in queues. Surprised, he asked God; where all these ants were coming from. God said, “All these ants were Indras in their past lives; I have called them to meet you.” Indra was speechless.Soon after, a revered sage, Rishi Lomash, visited Indra. He was carrying a straw mat on his head and had a circle of hair on his chest. However, there were gaps in that circle, made by fallen hair. Indra received the sage respectfully and then asked him politely; why he was carrying a mat on his head? Also, what does the hair on his chest signify?The Rishi said, “I am blessed with a boon, to be chirāyu (endless life). The hair on my chest signifies life on this universe. Whenever the tenure of an Indra ends, one hair falls. And several such falls have caused the gaps in my chest hair.” Indra was astonished. Lomash Rishi then added, “I carry this mat on my head because during the day it protects me from sun and rain. Also, I spread it on the ground at night and sleep. My disciples want to build a permanent residence for me to stay. But I think, when life itself is temporary, why build a house here?” Hearing this from someone who has the lifespan of many Indras; humbled Indra. His pride shattered, he thought to himself, “What is the point in building such a huge palace, if someday, I have to leave it all and go?” He asked Vishwakarma to stop the construction immediately and released him.It is marvellous how these stories from the Puranas and the Bhagavad Gita give an insight into; cosmology of the universe. Amazingly, these scriptures were written in ancient times, several thousand years ahead of modern astronomy. It was only in the sixteenth century that a western scientist, Nicholas Copernicus, first proposed a heliocentric theory stating that; the sun was the centre of the universe. This theory changed the previous belief that the earth was the centre of the universe.Further advancement in astronomy revealed that even the sun was not the centre of the universe. It was part of a galaxy called the milky way having countless stars like our sun, each with its own solar system. And all stars, along with their solar systems, are revolving around the epicentre of the galaxy. Further research has revealed; that similar to the Milky Way, several galaxies are gyrating in our universe.However, the Vedic philosophy states that the earth or the Bhūr Lok is revolving around Swar Lok, and the realm between them is Bhuvar Lok. The Swar Lok is again moving around Jana Lok, and the realm between these two is the Mahar Lok. Jana Lok is also not stationary and is circling the Brahma Lok (Satya Lok), and Tapa Lok is the realm between them. These are the seven higher planes, and similarly, there are seven lower planes as well. It is incredible; that our Vedic scholars had such insight into the subject over five thousand years ago.In this verse, Shree Krishna states that all the fourteen worlds of this universe are within the realm of His material energy Maya. Hence, the occupants are subject to the cycle of birth and death. Only those who attain God-realization get liberated from the clutches of maya. Upon death, they leave their material bodies and go to His divine abode to stay there forever. They receive divine bodies and participate in the divine Pastimes of God eternally.  They need not take birth in the material world.

8,17,सहस्रयुगपर्यन्तमहर्यद्ब्रह्मणो विदु: | रात्रिं युगसहस्रान्तां तेऽहोरात्रविदो जना: ॥17॥,"Those people who are knowers of what day and night are, know the day of Brahma which ends in a thousand yugas [The four yugas (in the human worlds), viz Satya, Treta, Dwapara, and Kali are made up of 4,320,000 years. This period multiplied by a thousand constitutes one day of Brahma. His night also extends over an equal period.], and His night which ends in a thousand yugas.","The Vedic cosmological system has measurements of time that are vast and astounding. Consider this example of an insect, that is, born at night and within the same night it grows, procreates, lays eggs, and grows old. The next morning, you find it dead under the street light. If one tells that insect that its entire lifespan was only equal to one night of a human, that will be unbelievable for the insect. Similarly, the measurements of time given in the Vedas are beyond normal human imagination.The Vedas state that one year on the earth equals; one day and night of Indra and other celestial gods. Thus, one year of the celestial gods consisting of 12 x 30 days equals 360 years on the earth plane. The calculation goes much further; 12,000 years of the celestial gods makes one mahā yug (cycle of four yugas) on the earth plane, that is, 4.32 million years. Following is the Vedic calculation of time periods or yugas on the earth plane:Kali Yug: 432,000 yearsDwāpar Yug: 864,000 yearsTretā Yug: 1,296,000 yearsSatya Yug: 1,728,000 yearsMahā Yug: 4,320,000 years (Adding the four yugas)Kalp: 4,320,000,000 years (1000 Mahā Yug = 1 day of Brahma)One thousand mahā yug make one day of Brahma, called a kalp, and then there is Brahma’s night of equal duration. Kalp is the largest unit of time in the world; it equals 4.32 billion years. In this verse, Shree Krishna states that only those who understand this knowledge truly know what day and night are.According to Vedas, the duration of the universe equals Brahma’s lifespan, of 100 years. Brahma’s one day and night put together make 8.64 billion earth years, and 36,000 such days of his lifespan would make 311 trillion 40 billion years. So, that will be one life cycle of our universe. Now the question arises; when Brahma is a creator, why is he also subject to birth and death?Brahma is also a soul; who has reached tremendously elevated consciousness. Thus, God has given him the position of Brahma, to discharge the duties as a creator on God’s behalf. But like all other living creatures, Brahma is also under the cycle of life and death. However, at the end of his tenure, he is liberated and goes to the Abode of God. Sometimes, at the creation of the world, when God does not find any eligible souls for the position of Brahma, God Himself becomes Brahma.",the vedic cosmological system measurements time vast astounding consider example insect born night within night grows procreates lays eggs grows old the next morning find dead street light if one tells insect entire lifespan equal one night human unbelievable insect similarly measurements time given vedas beyond normal human imaginationthe vedas state one year earth equals one day night indra celestial gods thus one year celestial gods consisting x days equals years earth plane the calculation goes much years celestial gods makes one mahā yug cycle four yugas earth plane million years following vedic calculation time periods yugas earth plane kali yug yearsdwāpar yug yearstretā yug yearssatya yug yearsmahā yug years adding four yugas kalp years mahā yug day brahma one thousand mahā yug make one day brahma called kalp brahma night equal duration kalp largest unit time world equals billion years in verse shree krishna states understand knowledge truly know day night areaccording vedas duration universe equals brahma lifespan years brahma one day night put together make billion earth years days lifespan would make trillion billion years so one life cycle universe now question arises brahma creator also subject birth death brahma also soul reached tremendously elevated consciousness thus god given position brahma discharge duties creator god behalf but like living creatures brahma also cycle life death however end tenure liberated goes abode god sometimes creation world god not find eligible souls position brahma god himself becomes brahma
8,18,अव्यक्ताद्व्यक्तय: सर्वा: प्रभवन्त्यहरागमे | रात्र्यागमे प्रलीयन्ते तत्रैवाव्यक्तसञ्ज्ञके ॥18॥,With the coming of day all manifested things emerge from the Unmanifest and when night comes they merge in that itself which is called the Unmanifested.,"The cosmic play of the various planes of existence in the universe is astounding. The fourteen worlds and their planetary systems undergo repeated cycles of sṛiṣhṭi, sthiti, and pralaya (creation, preservation, and dissolution). All planetary systems, up to the Mahar Lok, are destroyed at the end of a kalp; that is Brahma’s day of 4.32 billion years. This partial dissolution is called naimittik pralaya. When Shukdev Paramhans narrated the Shrimad Bhagavatam to Parikshit, he stated that Brahma creates these worlds similar to a child playing with his toys. A child builds structures with his toys during the day and pulls them apart before going to bed at night. Similarly, when Brahma wakes up, he creates the planetary systems and their life forms and dissolves them before going to sleep.The entire universe dissolves at the end of Brahma’s life of 100 years (311.04 trillion earth years). The whole material creation winds up. The pañch-mahābhūta merge into the pañch-tanmātrās, the pañch-tanmātrās merge into ahankār, ahankār merges into mahān, and mahān merges into prakṛiti. Prakṛiti is the subtle form of Maya, the material energy of God. Maya now takes up her primordial form. She goes back into the body of the Supreme Lord, Maha Vishnu. This great dissolution is called prākṛit pralaya, or mahāpralaya. When it is time for the next cycle of creation, Maha Vishnu glances at prakṛiti, and by His mere glance, prakṛiti starts unfolding herself again. From prakṛiti, mahān is created, from mahān, ahankār; then from ahankār, pañch-tanmātrās are created; from pañch-tanmātrās, pañch-mahābhūta get created.  And by this process, unlimited universes are created again.According to modern science, there are 100 billion stars in the Milky Way. And similar to the Milky Way, there are over a billion galaxies in the universe. Thus, scientists have concluded that in our universe, there are more than 10^20 stars. However, the Vedas state that, similar to our universe, there are infinite universes of various sizes and different features. These universes manifest from the body of Maha Vishnu. Every time He breathes in infinite universes are created from the pores of His divine body. And when He breathes out, they dissolve again. Thus, one breath of Maha Vishnu is equal to 100 years of Brahma’s life. Also, all these universes have their own Brahma, Vishnu, and Shankar. In the innumerable universes, there are innumerable Brahmas, Vishnus, and Shankars. The entire creation originates from Maha Vishnu, and at dissolution, merges back into Him.",the cosmic play various planes existence universe astounding the fourteen worlds planetary systems undergo repeated cycles sṛiṣhṭi sthiti pralaya creation preservation dissolution all planetary systems mahar lok destroyed end kalp brahma day billion years this partial dissolution called naimittik pralaya when shukdev paramhans narrated shrimad bhagavatam parikshit stated brahma creates worlds similar child playing toys a child builds structures toys day pulls apart going bed night similarly brahma wakes creates planetary systems life forms dissolves going sleepthe entire universe dissolves end brahma life years trillion earth years the whole material creation winds the pañchmahābhūta merge pañchtanmātrās pañchtanmātrās merge ahankār ahankār merges mahān mahān merges prakṛiti prakṛiti subtle form maya material energy god maya takes primordial form she goes back body supreme lord maha vishnu this great dissolution called prākṛit pralaya mahāpralaya when time next cycle creation maha vishnu glances prakṛiti his mere glance prakṛiti starts unfolding from prakṛiti mahān created mahān ahankār ahankār pañchtanmātrās created pañchtanmātrās pañchmahābhūta get created and process unlimited universes created againaccording modern science billion stars milky way and similar milky way billion galaxies universe thus scientists concluded universe stars however vedas state similar universe infinite universes various sizes different features these universes manifest body maha vishnu every time he breathes infinite universes created pores his divine body and he breathes dissolve thus one breath maha vishnu equal years brahma life also universes brahma vishnu shankar in innumerable universes innumerable brahmas vishnus shankars the entire creation originates maha vishnu dissolution merges back him

8,22,पुरुष: स पर: पार्थ भक्त्या लभ्यस्त्वनन्यया | यस्यान्त:स्थानि भूतानि येन सर्वमिदं ततम् ॥22॥,"O son of Prtha, that supreme Person-in whom are included (all) the beings and by whom all this is pervaded-is, indeed, reached through one-pointed devotion.","God is present everywhere. The same Supreme Lord who resides in the spiritual sky in His divine abode, at the same time, is seated in the hearts of every living creature. He is all-pervading and present in every atom of the material world. It is not that He is a hundred percent God in His personal form and ten percent when He is in our hearts or anywhere else in the material world. God exists a hundred percent in all His forms. Due to our ignorance, we are unable to recognize His presence within us or all around us.Sage Shandilya states in his Bhakti Darshan:gavāṁ sarpiḥ śharīrasthaṁ na karotyaṅga poṣhaṇam“Milk resides in the body of the cow, but it does not benefit the health of the cow, which is weak and sick.” When the same milk is converted to yogurt and fed to the cow with a little black pepper, it cures the cow; of its illness.Likewise, it is difficult to develop devotion for an omnipresent or all-pervading God. Worshiping Him in His divine form helps us purify our heart, which is necessary to attract His divine grace. Because, to perceive God’s divinity, we need our senses to be divine. By His grace, His divine energy Yogmaya instills in us divine senses, mind, and intellect so that we could know both His all-pervading aspect and His personal form. Thus, in this verse, Shree Krishna declares that only through bhakti can we know Him.In the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna has repeatedly emphasized upon the need for bhakti to know God and attain Him. The verse 6.47 states: Shree Krishna considers those engaged in devotion as the highest in position among His devotees. However, in this verse, Shree Krishna explicitly adds the term ananyayā, which means “by no other path” can one know God. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu very nicely said:bhakti mukha nirīkṣhaka karm yoga jñāna (Chaitanya Charitāmṛit, Madhya 22.17)“Although karma, jnana, and ashtanga yoga are also pathways to God-realization, all these require the support of bhakti for their fulfillment.” Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj also said:karm yog aru jñāna saba, sādhana yadapi bakhānpai binu bhakti sabai janu, mṛitaka deha binu prān(Bhakti Śhatak verse 8)“Although karma, jnana, and ashtanga yoga are paths to God-realization, without blending bhakti in them, they all become like dead bodies without life-airs.” Various other scriptures also announce the same:bhaktyāhamekayā grāhyaḥ śhraddhayātmā priyaḥ satām  (Bhagavatam 11.14.21)“I am only attained by My devotees who worship Me with faith and love.”milahiṅ na raghupati binu anurāgā, kieñ joga tapa gyāna birāgā  (Ramayan)“One may practice ashtanga yoga, engage in austerities, accumulate knowledge, and develop detachment.Yet, without devotion, one will never attain God.”",god present everywhere the supreme lord resides spiritual sky his divine abode time seated hearts every living creature he allpervading present every atom material world it not he hundred percent god his personal form ten percent he hearts anywhere else material world god exists hundred percent his forms due ignorance unable recognize his presence within us around ussage shandilya states bhakti darshan gavāṁ sarpiḥ śharīrasthaṁ na karotyaṅga poṣhaṇam milk resides body cow not benefit health cow weak sick when milk converted yogurt fed cow little black pepper cures cow illnesslikewise difficult develop devotion omnipresent allpervading god worshiping him his divine form helps us purify heart necessary attract his divine grace because perceive god divinity need senses divine by his grace his divine energy yogmaya instills us divine senses mind intellect could know his allpervading aspect his personal form thus verse shree krishna declares bhakti know himin bhagavad gita shree krishna repeatedly emphasized upon need bhakti know god attain him the verse states shree krishna considers engaged devotion highest position among his devotees however verse shree krishna explicitly adds term ananyayā means path one know god chaitanya mahaprabhu nicely said bhakti mukha nirīkṣhaka karm yoga jñāna chaitanya charitāmṛit madhya although karma jnana ashtanga yoga also pathways godrealization require support bhakti fulfillment jagadguru shree kripaluji maharaj also said karm yog aru jñāna saba sādhana yadapi bakhānpai binu bhakti sabai janu mṛitaka deha binu prān bhakti śhatak verse although karma jnana ashtanga yoga paths godrealization without blending bhakti become like dead bodies without lifeairs various scriptures also announce bhaktyāhamekayā grāhyaḥ śhraddhayātmā priyaḥ satām bhagavatam i attained my devotees worship me faith love milahiṅ na raghupati binu anurāgā kieñ joga tapa gyāna birāgā ramayan one may practice ashtanga yoga engage austerities accumulate knowledge develop detachmentyet without devotion one never attain god

Therefore, O Arjuna, be you steadfast in yoga at all times.","Those relentless souls who strive for Yog or union with God are true yogis. They recognize themselves to be tiny fragments of God and His eternal beatitude. They also realize the temporary nature of the material world and the futility of a materialistic life. Therefore, instead of running behind sensual pleasures, they endeavour to enhance their love for God. Such souls are on the path of light.On the other hand are the ignorant souls, who are under the influence of maya, the material energy. They recognize themselves as only the body and the material world around them as the source of their pleasure. They continue to live through the miseries of material existence, being disdainful toward God or His eternal opulence. Thus, such souls are on the path of darkness.In this verse, Shree Krishna urges Arjun to recognize the difference between these two paths and choose the path of light, thus become a yogi. It is not that many of us do not take the path of light, but after some time are back on the path of darkness. For instance, someone wishes to go east and walks one mile toward the rising sun in the morning. He rests in the afternoon for a while. Then he starts walking again toward the sun, which is now in the west. He walks for two miles only to find in the evening that he is one mile farther in the west from where he had started.  Similarly, treading on the path of light only for some time will not work; it needs to be a constant process, else one will slip back into darkness again. Therefore, in this verse, Shree Krishna adds the phrase, “at all times.” It is for us to recognize the importance of being a yogi at all times. And avoid the danger of sliding back into the path of darkness.",those relentless souls strive yog union god true yogis they recognize tiny fragments god his eternal beatitude they also realize temporary nature material world futility materialistic life therefore instead running behind sensual pleasures endeavour enhance love god such souls path lighton hand ignorant souls influence maya material energy they recognize body material world around source pleasure they continue live miseries material existence disdainful toward god his eternal opulence thus souls path darknessin verse shree krishna urges arjun recognize difference two paths choose path light thus become yogi it not many us not take path light time back path darkness for instance someone wishes go east walks one mile toward rising sun morning he rests afternoon then starts walking toward sun west he walks two miles find evening one mile farther west started similarly treading path light time not work needs constant process else one slip back darkness therefore verse shree krishna adds phrase times it us recognize importance yogi times and avoid danger sliding back path darkness

9,1,श्रीभगवानुवाच | इदं तु ते गुह्यतमं प्रवक्ष्याम्यनसूयवे | ज्ञानं विज्ञानसहितं यज्ज्ञात्वा मोक्ष्यसेऽशुभात् ॥1॥,"The Blessed Lord said: However, to you who are not given to cavilling I shall speak of this highest secret itself, which is Knowledge [Jnana may mean Brahman that is Consciousness, or Its knowledge gathered from the Vedas (paroksa-jnana). Vijnana is direct experience (aparoksa-jnana).] combined with experience, by realizing which you shall be free from evil.","At the very beginning of the topic, Shree Krishna declares the qualification for hearing these teachings.  Anasūyave means “non-envious.”  He tells Arjun that He is revealing this knowledge because Arjun is non-envious of Him.  Lord Krishna clarifies this because God is going to glorify Himself profusely here.  Anasūyave also has the sense of “one who does not scorn.”  Those listeners who deride Shree Krishna because they believe He is boasting will not benefit from hearing such a message.  Rather, they will incur harm, by thinking, “Look at this egotistic person.  He is praising His own Self.”  Such an attitude is born of arrogance and pride and it robs a person of devotional reverence.  Envious people cannot grasp the simple fact that God has no need for anything, and therefore everything He does is for the welfare of the souls.  He only praises Himself to enhance devotion in the souls, and not because He has the material defect of conceit as we do.  When Jesus of Nazareth said, “I am the path and the way,” he was saying it motivated by compassion for the souls listening to him, and not out of vanity.  As a true Guru, he was telling his disciples that the path to God is through the Guru.  But the envious-minded do not understand the compassion behind these statements and attribute them to self-conceit.  Since Arjun is magnanimous and free from the defect of envy, he is eminently qualified for the profound knowledge that Shree Krishna is going to reveal in this chapter. In the second chapter, Shree Krishna explained the knowledge of the ātmā (soul) as a separate and distinct entity from the body.   That is guhya, or secret knowledge.  In the seventh and eighth chapters, He explained knowledge of His powers, which is guhyatar, or more secret.  And in the ninth and subsequent chapters, He will reveal knowledge of His pure bhakti, which is guhyatam, or the most secret.",at beginning topic shree krishna declares qualification hearing teachings anasūyave means nonenvious he tells arjun he revealing knowledge arjun nonenvious him lord krishna clarifies god going glorify himself profusely anasūyave also sense one not scorn those listeners deride shree krishna believe he boasting not benefit hearing message rather incur harm thinking look egotistic person he praising his self such attitude born arrogance pride robs person devotional reverence envious people not grasp simple fact god need anything therefore everything he welfare souls he praises himself enhance devotion souls not he material defect conceit when jesus nazareth said i path way saying motivated compassion souls listening not vanity as true guru telling disciples path god guru but enviousminded not understand compassion behind statements attribute selfconceit since arjun magnanimous free defect envy eminently qualified profound knowledge shree krishna going reveal chapter in second chapter shree krishna explained knowledge ātmā soul separate distinct entity body that guhya secret knowledge in seventh eighth chapters he explained knowledge his powers guhyatar secret and ninth subsequent chapters he reveal knowledge his pure bhakti guhyatam secret
9,2,राजविद्या राजगुह्यं पवित्रमिदमुत्तमम् | प्रत्यक्षावगमं धर्म्यं सुसुखं कर्तुमव्ययम् ॥2॥,"This is the Sovereign Knowledge, the Sovereign Profundity, the best sanctifier; directly realizable, righteous, very easy to practise and imperishable.","Rāja means “king.”  Shree Krishna uses the metaphor rāja to emphasize the paramount position of the knowledge He is going to reveal. Vidyā means “science.”  He does not refer to His teachings as creed, religion, dogma, doctrine, or belief.  He declares that what He is going to describe to Arjun is the king of sciences. Guhya means “secret.”  This knowledge is also the supreme secret.  Since love is only possible where there is a choice, God deliberately hides Himself from direct perception, thereby providing the soul the freedom to exercise the choice of loving Him or not.  A machine cannot love, for it is devoid of choices.  God wants us to love Him and so He gives us the option to choose Him or not, as we wish.  He merely makes us aware of the consequences of what we choose, either way, and then leaves it to us to decide the path we wish to follow.Pavitram means “pure.”  Knowledge of devotion is supremely pure because it is untainted by petty selfishness.  It inspires sacrifice of the self at the altar of divine love for the Supreme Lord.  Bhakti also purifies the devotee by destroying pāp, bīja, and avidyā.  Pāp is the stockpile of past sins of endless lifetimes of the individual soul.  Bhakti burns them up as a fire burns up a bundle of straw.  Bīja refers to impurities of the heart, which are the seeds of sinful activities.  If the seeds exist, then destroying the results of past sins will not suffice, for the propensity to sin will remain in the heart and one will sin again.  Bhakti purifies the heart and destroys the seeds of sin, which are lust, anger, and greed.  However, even the destruction of the seeds is not enough.  The reason why the heart becomes impure is that there is avidyā (ignorance), because of which we identify with the body.  Because of this misidentification, we think of the body as the self, and hence create bodily desires thinking they will give happiness to the self.  Fulfillment of such material desires further leads to lust, anger, greed, and all the other impurities of the heart.  As long as the ignorance remains, even if the heart is cleansed, it will again become impure.  Devotion ultimately results in realized knowledge of the soul and God, which in turn destroys the ignorance of material existence.  The benefits of bhakti are described in the Bhakti Rasāmṛit Sindhu as follows:  kleśhas tu pāpaṁ tadbījam avidyā cheti te tridhā  (1.1.18)  “Bhakti destroys the three poisons—pāp (sins), bīja (the seed of sins), avidyā (the ignorance in the heart).”  Only when the three are completely destroyed, does the heart become truly and permanently pure. Pratyakṣha means “directly perceptible.”  The practice of the science of bhakti begins with a leap of faith and results in direct perception of God.  It is not unlike the methodology of other sciences, where we begin an experiment with a hypothesis and conclude with a verified result. Dharmyam means “virtuous.”  Devotion performed without desire for material rewards is the most virtuous action.  It is continuously nourished by righteous acts such as service to the Guru. Kartum susukham means “very easy to practice.”  God does not need anything from us; He is attained very naturally if we can learn to love Him. When this is the sovereign science and it is easy to practice, then why do people not apply themselves to learning it?  Shree Krishna explains this next.",rāja means king shree krishna uses metaphor rāja emphasize paramount position knowledge he going reveal vidyā means science he not refer his teachings creed religion dogma doctrine belief he declares he going describe arjun king sciences guhya means secret this knowledge also supreme secret since love possible choice god deliberately hides himself direct perception thereby providing soul freedom exercise choice loving him not a machine not love devoid choices god wants us love him he gives us option choose him not wish he merely makes us aware consequences choose either way leaves us decide path wish followpavitram means pure knowledge devotion supremely pure untainted petty selfishness it inspires sacrifice self altar divine love supreme lord bhakti also purifies devotee destroying pāp bīja avidyā pāp stockpile past sins endless lifetimes individual soul bhakti burns fire burns bundle straw bīja refers impurities heart seeds sinful activities if seeds exist destroying results past sins not suffice propensity sin remain heart one sin bhakti purifies heart destroys seeds sin lust anger greed however even destruction seeds not enough the reason heart becomes impure avidyā ignorance identify body because misidentification think body self hence create bodily desires thinking give happiness self fulfillment material desires leads lust anger greed impurities heart as long ignorance remains even heart cleansed become impure devotion ultimately results realized knowledge soul god turn destroys ignorance material existence the benefits bhakti described bhakti rasāmṛit sindhu follows kleśhas tu pāpaṁ tadbījam avidyā cheti te tridhā bhakti destroys three sins bīja seed sins avidyā ignorance heart only three completely destroyed heart become truly permanently pure pratyakṣha means directly perceptible the practice science bhakti begins leap faith results direct perception god it not unlike methodology sciences begin experiment hypothesis conclude verified result dharmyam means virtuous devotion performed without desire material rewards virtuous action it continuously nourished righteous acts service guru kartum susukham means easy practice god not need anything us he attained naturally learn love him when sovereign science easy practice people not apply learning shree krishna explains next
9,3,अश्रद्दधाना: पुरुषा धर्मस्यास्य परन्तप | अप्राप्य मां निवर्तन्ते मृत्युसंसारवर्त्मनि ॥3॥,"O destroyer of foes, persons who are regardless of this Dharma (knowledge of the Self) certainly go round and round, without reaching Me, along the path of transmigration which is fraught with death.","In the last two verses, Shree Krishna promised knowledge and then qualified it with eight merits.  It is mentioned here as “this dharma,” or the path of loving devotion to God. No matter how wonderful the knowledge and how effective the path, it remains useless to one who refuses to walk on it.  As explained in the previous verse, direct perception of God comes later; initially, a leap of faith is required to begin the process.  The Bhakti Rasāmṛit Sindhu (1.4.15) states:  ādau śhraddhā tataḥ sādhusaṅgo ’tha bhajanakriyā  “The first step in the path to God-realization is to have faith.  Then one begins participating in satsaṅg (spiritual programs).  This leads to the personal practice of devotion.” Often people say that they are only willing to believe in what they can directly perceive, and since there is no immediate perception of God, they do not believe in Him.  However, the fact is that we believe in so many things in the world too, without direct perception of them.  A judge delivers judgment upon a case concerning an event that took place many years in the past.  If the judge adopted the philosophy of believing only what he or she had directly experienced, then the entire legal system would fail.  A President administers a country on the basis of reports from all over the country.  It is impossible for him to visit and see all the villages and cities within his domain.  Now, if he was not willing to believe these reports, on the grounds that he had no direct perception of what was happening, how would he be able to administer the whole country?  So, even in material activities, faith is required at every step.  The Bible states this very nicely:  “We walk by faith, and not by sight.” (2 Corinthians 5:7) There is a beautiful story regarding perception of God.  A king once accosted a sadhu with the statement, “I do not believe in God because I cannot see Him.”  The sadhu asked for a cow to be brought to king’s court.  The king obliged and ordered his servants to bring a cow.  The sadhu then requested that it be milked.  The king again instructed his servants to do as the sadhu wanted.  The sadhu asked, “O King!  Do you believe that this milk, freshly taken out from the cow, contains butter?”  The king said he had full faith that it did.  The sadhu said, “You cannot see the butter in the milk.  Then why do you believe it is there?”  The king replied, “We cannot see it at present because the butter is pervading the milk, but there is a process for seeing it.  If we convert the milk into yogurt, and then churn the yogurt, the butter will become visible.”  The sadhu said, “Like the butter in the milk, God is everywhere.  If we cannot immediately perceive Him, we should not jump to the conclusion that there is no God.  There is a process for perceiving Him; if we are willing to have faith and follow the process, we will then get direct perception of God and become God-realized.”Belief in God is not a natural process that we as human beings just follow.  We have to exercise our free will and actively make a decision to have faith in God.  In the assembly of the Kauravas, when Dushasan endeavored to disrobe Draupadi, Lord Krishna saved her from shame and embarrassment by lengthening her sari.  All the Kauravas present saw this miracle, but refused to have faith in the omnipotence of Shree Krishna and come to their senses.  The Supreme Lord says in this verse that those who choose not to have faith in the spiritual path remain bereft of divine wisdom and continue rotating in the cycle of life and death.",in last two verses shree krishna promised knowledge qualified eight merits it mentioned dharma path loving devotion god no matter wonderful knowledge effective path remains useless one refuses walk as explained previous verse direct perception god comes later initially leap faith required begin process the bhakti rasāmṛit sindhu states ādau śhraddhā tataḥ sādhusaṅgo tha bhajanakriyā the first step path godrealization faith then one begins participating satsaṅg spiritual programs this leads personal practice devotion often people say willing believe directly perceive since immediate perception god not believe him however fact believe many things world without direct perception a judge delivers judgment upon case concerning event took place many years past if judge adopted philosophy believing directly experienced entire legal system would fail a president administers country basis reports country it impossible visit see villages cities within domain now not willing believe reports grounds direct perception happening would able administer whole country so even material activities faith required every step the bible states nicely we walk faith not sight corinthians there beautiful story regarding perception god a king accosted sadhu statement i not believe god i not see him the sadhu asked cow brought king court the king obliged ordered servants bring cow the sadhu requested milked the king instructed servants sadhu wanted the sadhu asked o king do believe milk freshly taken cow contains butter the king said full faith the sadhu said you not see butter milk then believe the king replied we not see present butter pervading milk process seeing if convert milk yogurt churn yogurt butter become visible the sadhu said like butter milk god everywhere if not immediately perceive him not jump conclusion god there process perceiving him willing faith follow process get direct perception god become godrealized belief god not natural process human beings follow we exercise free actively make decision faith god in assembly kauravas dushasan endeavored disrobe draupadi lord krishna saved shame embarrassment lengthening sari all kauravas present saw miracle refused faith omnipotence shree krishna come senses the supreme lord says verse choose not faith spiritual path remain bereft divine wisdom continue rotating cycle life death

All beings exist in Me, but I am not contained in them!","The Vedic philosophy does not accept the concept of God creating the world and then peeping into it from the seventh heaven to check whether His world is running all right.  They repeatedly propound the theme of God being all-pervading in the world:eko devaḥ sarvabhūteṣhu gūḍhaḥ sarvavyāpī   (Śhwetāśhvatar Upaniṣhad 6.11)“There is one God; He is seated in everyone’s heart; He is also everywhere in the world.” īśhāvāsyam idam sarvaṁ yat kiñcha jagatyāṁ jagat   (Īśhopaniṣhad 1)“God is everywhere in the world.”puruṣha evedaṁ sarvaṁ, yad bhūtaṁ yachcha bhavyam   (Puruṣh Sūktam)“God pervades everything that has existed and all that will exist.”This concept of God being everywhere is understood subjectively.  Some Eastern philosophers claim that the world is a pariṇām (transformation) of God.  For example, milk is an unadulterated substance.  In contact with acid, it transforms to yogurt.  Thus, yogurt is a pariṇām (effect or product) of milk, when it is transformed.  Similarly, the protagonists of pariṇām vāda state that God has transformed into the world. Other philosophers claim that the world is vivarta (to mistake one object for another).  For example, in the darkness a rope may be mistaken for a snake.  In the moonlight, a shining oyster may be mistaken for silver.  Similarly, they say that there is only God and no world; what we are seeing as the world is actually Brahman. However, according to verses 7.4 and 7.5, the world is neither pariṇām nor vivarta.  It is created from the material energy of God, called Maya śhakti.  The souls too are the energy of God, but they are His superior energy, called Jīva śhakti.  Therefore, the world and all the souls in it are both God’s energies and are within His personality.  However, Shree Krishna also says that He does not dwell in the living beings, i.e. the infinite is not contained by the finite beings.  That is because He is far more than the sum total of these two energies.  Just as an ocean throws up many waves, and these waves are a part of the ocean, but the ocean is much more than the sum total of the waves,  similarly too, the souls and Maya exist within the personality of God, yet He is beyond them.",the vedic philosophy not accept concept god creating world peeping seventh heaven check whether his world running right they repeatedly propound theme god allpervading world eko devaḥ sarvabhūteṣhu gūḍhaḥ sarvavyāpī śhwetāśhvatar upaniṣhad there one god he seated everyone heart he also everywhere world īśhāvāsyam idam sarvaṁ yat kiñcha jagatyāṁ jagat īśhopaniṣhad god everywhere world puruṣha evedaṁ sarvaṁ yad bhūtaṁ yachcha bhavyam puruṣh sūktam god pervades everything existed exist this concept god everywhere understood subjectively some eastern philosophers claim world pariṇām transformation god for example milk unadulterated substance in contact acid transforms yogurt thus yogurt pariṇām effect product milk transformed similarly protagonists pariṇām vāda state god transformed world other philosophers claim world vivarta mistake one object another for example darkness rope may mistaken snake in moonlight shining oyster may mistaken silver similarly say god world seeing world actually brahman however according verses world neither pariṇām vivarta it created material energy god called maya śhakti the souls energy god his superior energy called jīva śhakti therefore world souls god energies within his personality however shree krishna also says he not dwell living beings ie infinite not contained finite beings that he far sum total two energies just ocean throws many waves waves part ocean ocean much sum total waves similarly souls maya exist within personality god yet he beyond

9,11,अवजानन्ति मां मूढा मानुषीं तनुमाश्रितम् | परं भावमजानन्तो मम भूतमहेश्वरम् ॥11॥,"Not knowing My supreme nature as the Lord of all beings, foolish people disregard Me who have taken a human body.","Good teachers occasionally use strong words to jostle their students out of the complacence of shallow thinking, into a deeper state of thoughtfulness.  Here, Shree Krishna uses the word mūḍha, which means “dim-witted,” to describe those who deny the divinity of His personal form.Those who say that God is only formless and cannot manifest in a personal form, contradict the definition of God as being all-mighty and all-powerful.  The Supreme Lord has created this entire world full of forms, shapes, and colors.  If He can do such an amazing feat of creating myriad forms in the world, can He not create a form for Himself?  Or is it that God says, “I do not have the power to manifest in a personal form, and hence I am only formless light.”  To say that He cannot possess a personal form makes Him incomplete. We tiny souls also possess forms.  If one holds that God cannot possess a form, then the corollary is that He has even less power than us a human beings.  For God to be perfect and complete, He must have both attributes to His personality—a personal aspect and a formless aspect.  The Vedic scriptures state:apaśhyaṁ gopāṁ anipadyamānamā(Ṛig Veda 1.22.164 sūkta 31)“I had the vision of God as a boy who is never annihilated, and who appeared in a family of cowherds.”dwibhūjaṁ mauna mudrāḍhyaṁ vana mālinamīśhwaram(Gopāl Tāpani Upaniṣhad 1.13)“The Lord, wearing a garland of forest flowers, plays His flute, enchantingly forming the mauna mudrā with His hands.”gūḍhaṁ paraṁ brahma manuṣhya-liṅgam(Bhagavatam 7.15.75)“The deepest knowledge is that God accepts a human-like form.” yatrāvatīrṇo bhagavān paramātmā narākṛitiḥ(Bhagavatam 9.23.20)“At that time, the Supreme Lord, who possesses all opulences, descended in a human-like form.”īśhwaraḥ paramaḥ kṛiṣhṇaḥ sachchidānanda vigrahaḥanādirādir govindaḥ sarvakāraṇa kāraṇam(Brahma Samhitā 5.1)In this verse, Brahma prays to Shree Krishna, “I worship Lord Krishna whose form is eternal, all-knowing, and blissful.  He is without beginning and end, and is the cause of all causes.” However, in regard to the personal form of God, we must keep in mind that it is a divine form, which means it is devoid of all the defects found in material forms.  The form of God is sat-chit-ānand—it is eternal, full of knowledge, and constituted of divine bliss. asyāpi deva vapuṣho mad-anugrahasyasvechchhā-mayasya na tu bhūta-mayasya ko ’pi(Bhagavatam 10.14.2)In this verse, Lord Brahma prays to Shree Krishna, “O Lord, Your body is not made of pañch mahābhūta (the five great elements); it is divine.  And You have descended in this form by Your own free will, to bestow Your grace upon souls like myself.”In chapter four of the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna stated: “Although I am unborn, the Lord of all living entities, and have an imperishable nature, yet I appear in this world by virtue of Yogmaya, my divine power.” (4.6)  This means that not only does God possess a form, but He also descends in the world as an Avatar. Since we souls have been taking births in the world from time immemorial, it is plausible that we were present in the human form on the earth when a previous descension of God was present on the earth.  It is even possible that we saw the descension.  However, the limitation was that God’s form was divine and we possessed material eyes.  So when we saw Him with our eyes, we were unable to recognize the divinity of His personality.  The divine nature of God’s form is such that His divinity is perceived by each person only to the extent of his or her spiritual power.  When those who are influenced by sattva guṇa see Him, they think, “Shree Krishna is a special person. He is very competent but is definitely not God.”  When those under the spell of rajo guṇa see Him, they say, “There is nothing special in Him.  He is very much like us.”  When those dominated by tamo guṇa see Him, they think, “He is egotistic and characterless, much worse than us.”  It is only the God-realized saints who can recognize Him as God, since they have received divine vision by His grace.  And so, Shree Krishna says that the unaware materially conditioned souls do not know Him when He takes an avatar in the world.",good teachers occasionally use strong words jostle students complacence shallow thinking deeper state thoughtfulness here shree krishna uses word mūḍha means dimwitted describe deny divinity his personal formthose say god formless not manifest personal form contradict definition god allmighty allpowerful the supreme lord created entire world full forms shapes colors if he amazing feat creating myriad forms world he not create form himself or god says i not power manifest personal form hence i formless light to say he not possess personal form makes him incomplete we tiny souls also possess forms if one holds god not possess form corollary he even less power us human beings for god perfect complete he must attributes his personal aspect formless aspect the vedic scriptures state apaśhyaṁ gopāṁ anipadyamānamā ṛig veda sūkta i vision god boy never annihilated appeared family cowherds dwibhūjaṁ mauna mudrāḍhyaṁ vana mālinamīśhwaram gopāl tāpani upaniṣhad the lord wearing garland forest flowers plays his flute enchantingly forming mauna mudrā his hands gūḍhaṁ paraṁ brahma manuṣhyaliṅgam bhagavatam the deepest knowledge god accepts humanlike form yatrāvatīrṇo bhagavān paramātmā narākṛitiḥ bhagavatam at time supreme lord possesses opulences descended humanlike form īśhwaraḥ paramaḥ kṛiṣhṇaḥ sachchidānanda vigrahaḥanādirādir govindaḥ sarvakāraṇa kāraṇam brahma samhitā in verse brahma prays shree krishna i worship lord krishna whose form eternal allknowing blissful he without beginning end cause causes however regard personal form god must keep mind divine form means devoid defects found material forms the form god eternal full knowledge constituted divine bliss asyāpi deva vapuṣho madanugrahasyasvechchhāmayasya na tu bhūtamayasya ko pi bhagavatam in verse lord brahma prays shree krishna o lord your body not made pañch mahābhūta five great elements divine and you descended form your free bestow your grace upon souls like myself in chapter four bhagavad gita shree krishna stated although i unborn lord living entities imperishable nature yet i appear world virtue yogmaya divine power this means not god possess form he also descends world avatar since souls taking births world time immemorial plausible present human form earth previous descension god present earth it even possible saw descension however limitation god form divine possessed material eyes so saw him eyes unable recognize divinity his personality the divine nature god form his divinity perceived person extent spiritual power when influenced sattva guṇa see him think shree krishna special person he competent definitely not god when spell rajo guṇa see him say there nothing special him he much like us when dominated tamo guṇa see him think he egotistic characterless much worse us it godrealized saints recognize him god since received divine vision his grace and shree krishna says unaware materially conditioned souls not know him he takes avatar world

9,14,सततं कीर्तयन्तो मां यतन्तश्च दृढव्रता: | नमस्यन्तश्च मां भक्त्या नित्ययुक्ता उपासते ॥14॥,"Always glorifying Me and striving, the men of firm vows worship Me by paying obeisance to Me and being ever endowed with devotion.","Having said that the great souls engage in His devotion, Shree Krishna now explains how they do bhakti.  He says that devotees become attached to kīrtan as a means of practicing their devotion and enhancing it.  The chanting of the glories of the Lord is called kīrtan, which is defined as:  nāma-līlā-guṇadīnām uchchair-bhāṣhā tu kīrtanam (Bhakti Rasāmṛit Sindhu 1.2.145)  “Singing glories of the Names, Forms, Qualities, Pastimes, Abodes, and Associates of God is called kīrtan.” Kīrtan is one of the most powerful means of practicing devotion.  It involves the three-fold devotion of śhravaṇa (hearing), kīrtan (chanting), and smaraṇa (remembering).  The goal is to fix the mind upon God, but it becomes easier when done alongside with hearing and chanting.  As stated in chapter six, the mind is as restless as the wind, and naturally wanders from thought to thought.  Hearing and chanting engage the knowledge senses in the divine realm, which helps in repeatedly bringing back the mind from its wanderings. Kīrtan has many other benefits as well.  Often when people practice devotion through japa (chanting of mantra or Name of God on rosary beads) or plain meditation, they find themselves overwhelmed by sleep.  However, kīrtan is such an engaging process that it usually drives sleep away.  Also, chanting blocks out distracting sounds from the environment.  Kīrtan can be practiced in groups which enables mass participation.  In addition, the mind desires variety, which it gets through the medium of kīrtan in the form of the Names, Virtues, Pastimes, Abodes, etc. of God.  And since kīrtan involves loud chanting, the divine vibrations of the Names of God make the entire environment auspicious and holy. For all these reasons, kīrtan has been the most popular form of devotion amongst saints in Indian history.  All the famous bhakti Saints—Soordas, Tulsidas, Meerabai, Guru Nanak, Kabir, Tukaram, Ekanath, Narsi Mehta, Jayadev, Tyagaraja, and others—were great poets.  They composed numerous devotional songs, and through them, they engaged in chanting, hearing, and remembering.The Vedic scriptures particularly extol kīrtan as the simplest and most powerful process of devotion in the present age of Kali. kṛite yad dhyāyato viṣhṇuṁ tretāyāṁ yajato makhaiḥdwāpare paricharyāyāṁ kalau tad dhari-kīrtanāt   (Bhagavatam 12.3.52)“The best process of devotion in the age of Satya was simple meditation upon God.  In the age of Tretā, it was the performance of sacrifices for the pleasure of God.  In the age of Dwāpar, worship of the deities was the recommended process.  In the present age of Kali, it is kīrtan alone.”avikārī vā vikārī vā sarva doṣhaika bhājanaḥparameṣha padaṁ yāti rāma nāmānukīrtanāt   (Adhyātma Ramayan)“Whether you are full of desires or free from them, devoid of defects or full of them, if you engage in kīrtan of the names of Lord Ram, you will attain the highest destination.” sarva dharma bahirbhūtaḥ sarva pāparatasthathāmuchyate nātra sandeho viṣhṇornamānukīrtanāt   (Vaiśhampāyan Samhitā)“Even those who are deeply sinful and bereft of religiosity can be saved by the chanting of the names of Lord Vishnu; of this, there is no doubt.”kalijuga kevala hari guna gāhā, gāvata nara pāvahiṅ bhava thāhā   (Ramayan)“In this age of Kali, there is one means of salvation.  By engaging in the chanting of the glories of God, one can cross over this material ocean.” However, one must remember that in the process of kīrtan, hearing and chanting are helpers.  The essence is to remember God.  If we leave it out, the kīrtan will not purify the mind.  Thus, Shree Krishna says here that His devotees do kīrtan, while constantly engaging the mind in thinking of Him.  They practice this with great determination for the purification of the mind.",having said great souls engage his devotion shree krishna explains bhakti he says devotees become attached kīrtan means practicing devotion enhancing the chanting glories lord called kīrtan defined nāmalīlāguṇadīnām uchchairbhāṣhā tu kīrtanam bhakti rasāmṛit sindhu singing glories names forms qualities pastimes abodes associates god called kīrtan kīrtan one powerful means practicing devotion it involves threefold devotion śhravaṇa hearing kīrtan chanting smaraṇa remembering the goal fix mind upon god becomes easier done alongside hearing chanting as stated chapter six mind restless wind naturally wanders thought thought hearing chanting engage knowledge senses divine realm helps repeatedly bringing back mind wanderings kīrtan many benefits well often people practice devotion japa chanting mantra name god rosary beads plain meditation find overwhelmed sleep however kīrtan engaging process usually drives sleep away also chanting blocks distracting sounds environment kīrtan practiced groups enables mass participation in addition mind desires variety gets medium kīrtan form names virtues pastimes abodes etc god and since kīrtan involves loud chanting divine vibrations names god make entire environment auspicious holy for reasons kīrtan popular form devotion amongst saints indian history all famous bhakti tulsidas meerabai guru nanak kabir tukaram ekanath narsi mehta jayadev tyagaraja great poets they composed numerous devotional songs engaged chanting hearing rememberingthe vedic scriptures particularly extol kīrtan simplest powerful process devotion present age kali kṛite yad dhyāyato viṣhṇuṁ tretāyāṁ yajato makhaiḥdwāpare paricharyāyāṁ kalau tad dharikīrtanāt bhagavatam the best process devotion age satya simple meditation upon god in age tretā performance sacrifices pleasure god in age dwāpar worship deities recommended process in present age kali kīrtan alone avikārī vā vikārī vā sarva doṣhaika bhājanaḥparameṣha padaṁ yāti rāma nāmānukīrtanāt adhyātma ramayan whether full desires free devoid defects full engage kīrtan names lord ram attain highest destination sarva dharma bahirbhūtaḥ sarva pāparatasthathāmuchyate nātra sandeho viṣhṇornamānukīrtanāt vaiśhampāyan samhitā even deeply sinful bereft religiosity saved chanting names lord vishnu doubt kalijuga kevala hari guna gāhā gāvata nara pāvahiṅ bhava thāhā ramayan in age kali one means salvation by engaging chanting glories god one cross material ocean however one must remember process kīrtan hearing chanting helpers the essence remember god if leave kīrtan not purify mind thus shree krishna says his devotees kīrtan constantly engaging mind thinking him they practice great determination purification mind

9,18,गतिर्भर्ता प्रभु: साक्षी निवास: शरणं सुहृत् | प्रभव: प्रलय: स्थानं निधानं बीजमव्ययम् ॥18॥,"(I am) the fruit of actions, the nourisher, the Lord, witness, abode, refuge, friend, origin, end, foundation, store and the imperishable seed.","Since the soul is a tiny part of God, its every relationship is with Him.  However, in bodily consciousness, we look upon the relatives of the body as our father, mother, beloved, child, and friend.  We become attached to them and repeatedly bring them to our mind, thereby getting further bound in the material illusion.  But none of these worldly relatives can give us the perfect love that our soul yearns for.  This is for two reasons.  Firstly, these relationships are temporary, and separation is unavoidable when either they or we depart from the world.  Secondly, even as long as they are alive, the attachment is based on selfishness and so it fluctuates in direct proportion to the extent by which self-interest is satisfied.  Thus, the range and intensity of worldly love varies from moment to moment, throughout the day.  “My wife is very nice….she is not so nice…she is ok….she is terrible,” this is the extent of fluctuation of love in the drama of the world.  On the other hand, God is such a relative who has accompanied us lifetime after lifetime.  From birth to birth, in every life-form that we went, God accompanied us and remained seated in our heart.  He is thus our eternal relative.  In addition, He has no self-interest from us; He is perfect and complete in Himself.  He loves us selflessly, for He only desires our eternal welfare.  Thus, God alone is our perfect relative, who is both eternal and selfless.To understand this concept from another perspective, consider the analogy of an ocean and the waves that emerge from it.  Two neighboring waves in the ocean flow together for some time, and play mirthfully with each other, creating the impression that they have a very deep relationship between them.  However, after travelling some distance, one subsides into the ocean, and shortly after, the other does the same.  Did they have any relationship between themselves?  No, they were both born from the ocean and their relationship was with the ocean itself.  Similarly, God is like the ocean and we are like waves who have emanated from Him.  We create attachments amongst our bodily relations, only to leave everyone upon death, and journey alone into another birth.  The truth is that the souls are not related to each other, but to God, from whom they have all emanated.In this verse, Shree Krishna takes us above bodily consciousness and its concomitant attachment to worldly relatives.  From the platform of the soul, God alone is all our relationships; He is our Father, Mother, Sister, Brother, Beloved, and Friend.  This theme is reiterated in all the Vedic scriptures:divyo deva eko nārāyaṇo mātā pitā bhrātā suhṛit gatiḥ  nivāsaḥ śharaṇaṁ suhṛit gatirnārāyaṇa iti  (Subāl Śhruti, mantra 6) “Lord Narayan alone is the Mother, Father, Beloved, and destination of the soul.”more sabai eka tumha swāmī, dīnabhandhu ura antarajāmī.   (Ramayan)“O Lord Ram, You alone are my Master, the Savior of the destitute, and the Knower of the heart.”  Knowing the magnitude of our eternal relationship with God, we must endeavor to attach our mind to Him alone.  Then, the mind will be purified and we will be able to fulfill the condition of māmekaṁ śharaṇaṁ vraja, or complete surrender, which is necessary for receiving God’s grace.  To achieve this single-mindedness, we must cut all the present attachments of the mind and replace them with attachment to God.  Hence, the Ramayan states:saba kai mamatā tāga baṭorī, mama pada manahi bāñdha bari ḍorī.“Cut all the strings of worldly attachment of your mind; make a rope of these strings, and tie it at the lotus feet of God.”  To help us tie our mind to Him, Shree Krishna here explains to Arjun that the soul’s every relationship is with God alone.",since soul tiny part god every relationship him however bodily consciousness look upon relatives body father mother beloved child friend we become attached repeatedly bring mind thereby getting bound material illusion but none worldly relatives give us perfect love soul yearns this two reasons firstly relationships temporary separation unavoidable either depart world secondly even long alive attachment based selfishness fluctuates direct proportion extent selfinterest satisfied thus range intensity worldly love varies moment moment throughout day my wife not terrible extent fluctuation love drama world on hand god relative accompanied us lifetime lifetime from birth birth every lifeform went god accompanied us remained seated heart he thus eternal relative in addition he selfinterest us he perfect complete himself he loves us selflessly he desires eternal welfare thus god alone perfect relative eternal selflessto understand concept another perspective consider analogy ocean waves emerge two neighboring waves ocean flow together time play mirthfully creating impression deep relationship however travelling distance one subsides ocean shortly did relationship no born ocean relationship ocean similarly god like ocean like waves emanated him we create attachments amongst bodily relations leave everyone upon death journey alone another birth the truth souls not related god emanatedin verse shree krishna takes us bodily consciousness concomitant attachment worldly relatives from platform soul god alone relationships he father mother sister brother beloved friend this theme reiterated vedic scriptures divyo deva eko nārāyaṇo mātā pitā bhrātā suhṛit gatiḥ nivāsaḥ śharaṇaṁ suhṛit gatirnārāyaṇa iti subāl śhruti mantra lord narayan alone mother father beloved destination soul sabai eka tumha swāmī dīnabhandhu ura antarajāmī ramayan o lord ram you alone master savior destitute knower heart knowing magnitude eternal relationship god must endeavor attach mind him alone then mind purified able fulfill condition māmekaṁ śharaṇaṁ vraja complete surrender necessary receiving god grace to achieve singlemindedness must cut present attachments mind replace attachment god hence ramayan states saba kai mamatā tāga baṭorī mama pada manahi bāñdha bari ḍorī cut strings worldly attachment mind make rope strings tie lotus feet god to help us tie mind him shree krishna explains arjun soul every relationship god alone

even that will suffice, provided it is a gift of love.  If leaves are also scarce, make an offering of water, which is available everywhere, but ensure again that you do it with devotion.  The word bhaktyā has been used in both the first and second lines of the verse.  It is the bhakti of the devotee that is pleasing to God, and not the worth of the offering.By making this wonderful statement, Shree Krishna reveals the merciful divine nature of God.  He is not concerned with the material value of our offering.  Rather, He values, above everything else, the love with which we make the offering.  Thus, the Hari Bhakti Vilas states:tulasī-dala-mātreṇa jalasya chulukena chavikrīṇīte svam ātmānaṁ bhaktebhyo bhakta-vatsalaḥ   (11.261)“If you offer God with sincere love, just a Tulsī leaf and as much water as you can hold in your palm, He will offer Himself to you in return because He is endeared by love.”  How wonderful it is that the Supreme Master of unlimited universes, whose glorious qualities and virtues are amazing beyond description, and by whose mere thought multitudes of universes come into existence and disappear again, accepts even the most humble offering of His devotee that is given with genuine love.  The word used here is prayatātmanaḥ, implying, “I accept the offerings of those whose hearts are pure.”The Shreemad Bhagavatam contains exactly the same verse as the above verse of the Bhagavad Gita.  While eating dry rice at the house of His friend, Sudama, Shree Krishna said:patraṁ puṣhpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayachchhatitadahaṁ bhaktyupahṛitam aśhnāmi prayatātmanaḥ   (10.81.4)“If one offers Me with devotion, a leaf, a flower, a fruit, or even water, I delightfully partake of that article offered with love by My devotee in pure consciousness.”Whenever God descends upon the earth, He exhibits this quality in His divine Pastimes.  Before the Mahabharat war, when Shree Krishna went to Hastinapur to explore the possibility of fashioning an agreement between the Kauravas and Pandavas, the evil Duryodhan had proudly prepared for Him a meal with fifty-six different items.  However, Shree Krishna rejected his hospitality and instead went to the humble hut of Vidurani, who had been longing deeply for the opportunity to serve her beloved Lord.  Vidurani was overjoyed on receiving the Supreme Lord at her home.  All she had to offer was bananas, but her intellect so benumbed with loving sentiments that she did not even realize she was dropping the fruit and putting the banana peels in His mouth.  Nevertheless, seeing her devotion, Shree Krishna blissfully ate the peels, as if they were the most delicious food in the world.",having established benefits worshipping supreme shree krishna explains easy in worship devatās ancestors many rules propitiate must strictly followed but god accepts anything offered loving heart if fruit offer god he pleased if fruit available offer him flower if not season flowers offer god mere leaf even suffice provided gift love if leaves also scarce make offering water available everywhere ensure devotion the word bhaktyā used first second lines verse it bhakti devotee pleasing god not worth offeringby making wonderful statement shree krishna reveals merciful divine nature god he not concerned material value offering rather he values everything else love make offering thus hari bhakti vilas states tulasīdalamātreṇa jalasya chulukena chavikrīṇīte svam ātmānaṁ bhaktebhyo bhaktavatsalaḥ if offer god sincere love tulsī leaf much water hold palm he offer himself return he endeared love how wonderful supreme master unlimited universes whose glorious qualities virtues amazing beyond description whose mere thought multitudes universes come existence disappear accepts even humble offering his devotee given genuine love the word used prayatātmanaḥ implying i accept offerings whose hearts pure the shreemad bhagavatam contains exactly verse verse bhagavad gita while eating dry rice house his friend sudama shree krishna said patraṁ puṣhpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo bhaktyā prayachchhatitadahaṁ bhaktyupahṛitam aśhnāmi prayatātmanaḥ if one offers me devotion leaf flower fruit even water i delightfully partake article offered love my devotee pure consciousness whenever god descends upon earth he exhibits quality his divine pastimes before mahabharat war shree krishna went hastinapur explore possibility fashioning agreement kauravas pandavas evil duryodhan proudly prepared him meal fiftysix different items however shree krishna rejected hospitality instead went humble hut vidurani longing deeply opportunity serve beloved lord vidurani overjoyed receiving supreme lord home all offer bananas intellect benumbed loving sentiments not even realize dropping fruit putting banana peels his mouth nevertheless seeing devotion shree krishna blissfully ate peels delicious food world

But those who worship Me with devotion, they exist in Me, and I too exist in them.","We all intuitively believe that if there is a God, He must be perfectly just; there cannot be an unjust God.  People suffering injustice in the world make statements such as, “Mr. Billionaire, you have the power of money on your side. Do what you like.  God will settle our dispute.  He is watching and will definitely punish you.  You cannot escape.”  This sort of statement does not indicate that the person making it is a saint, possessing absolute faith in God, for even common persons believe that God is perfectly just. However, the previous verse by Shree Krishna creates the doubt that God is partial toward His devotees, because while everyone is subject to the law of karma, God releases His devotees from it.  Isn’t this symptomatic of the defect of partiality?  Shree Krishna feels it necessary to clarify this point and begins the verse by saying samo’ ham, meaning, “No, no, I am equal to all.  But I have a uniform law in accordance with which I bestow My grace.”  This law was previously stated in verse 4.11: “In whatever way people surrender unto Me, I reciprocate accordingly. Everyone follows my path, knowingly or unknowingly, O son of Pritha.”The rainwater falls equally upon the earth.  Yet, the drop that falls on the cornfields gets converted into grain; the drop that falls on the desert bush gets converted into a thorn; the drop that falls in the gutter becomes dirty water; and the drop that falls in the oyster becomes a pearl.  There is no partiality on the part of the rain, since it is equitable in bestowing its grace upon the land.  The raindrops cannot be held responsible for this variation in results, which are a consequence of the nature of the recipient.  Similarly, God states here that He is equally disposed toward all living beings, and yet, those who do not love Him are bereft of the benefits of His grace because their hearts are unsuitable vessels for receiving it.  So, what can people do whose hearts are impure?  Shree Krishna now reveals the purifying power of bhakti.",we intuitively believe god he must perfectly not unjust god people suffering injustice world make statements mr billionaire power money side do like god settle dispute he watching definitely punish you not escape this sort statement not indicate person making saint possessing absolute faith god even common persons believe god perfectly however previous verse shree krishna creates doubt god partial toward his devotees everyone subject law karma god releases his devotees isn symptomatic defect partiality shree krishna feels necessary clarify point begins verse saying samo ham meaning no i equal but i uniform law accordance i bestow my grace this law previously stated verse in whatever way people surrender unto me i reciprocate accordingly everyone follows path knowingly unknowingly o son pritha the rainwater falls equally upon earth yet drop falls cornfields gets converted grain drop falls desert bush gets converted thorn drop falls gutter becomes dirty water drop falls oyster becomes pearl there partiality part rain since equitable bestowing grace upon land the raindrops not held responsible variation results consequence nature recipient similarly god states he equally disposed toward living beings yet not love him bereft benefits his grace hearts unsuitable vessels receiving so people whose hearts impure shree krishna reveals purifying power bhakti

Do you proclaim boldly, O son of Kunti, that My devotee does not get ruined.","How can devotees be considered venerable, merely for having made the correct resolve?  Shree Krishna explains that if they continue the process of exclusive devotion with unflinching faith in God, their hearts will become purified and they will swiftly develop saintly virtues. Divine virtues emanate from God Himself.  He is perfectly just, truthful, compassionate, loving, merciful, etc.  Since we souls are His tiny parts, we are all naturally drawn to these godly qualities.  But the process of becoming virtuous remains an elusive mystery.  From childhood, we have heard that we must speak the truth, serve others, be free from anger, etc. and yet we are unable to put those teachings into practice for the simple reason that our mind is impure.  Without purification of the mind, blemishes of character cannot be eradicated fully and permanently.  Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj declares the irrefutable truth regarding developing divine virtues:satya ahinsā ādi mana! bina hari bhajana na pāyajala te ghṛita nikale nahīñ, koṭina kariya upāya   (Bhakti Śhatak verse 35)“Oil stains on a cloth cannot be removed by water, no matter how much we try.  Similarly, truthfulness, non-violence, and other virtuous qualities cannot be acquired without engaging in devotion to God.”  These qualities manifest when the mind is purified; and the purification of the mind cannot take place without attaching it to the all-pure God. Further, Shree Krishna asks Arjun to boldly declare that His devotees will never perish.  He does not say, “The jñānī (person of knowledge) will not be lost.”  Nor does He say, “The karmī (performer of rituals) shall not perish.”  He makes His promise for His bhaktas (devotees), saying that “they shall never come to ruin.”  Thereby, He reiterates what He had stated in verse 9.22, that He personally carries the burden of maintaining those who depend upon Him and engage in exclusive devotion unto Him.It may seem intriguing why Shree Krishna asks Arjun to make this statement, instead of declaring it Himself?  The reason is that under special circumstances the Lord sometimes breaks His word, but He never permits His devotees’ word to be broken.  For example, Shree Krishna had resolved that He would not lift weapons during the Mahabharat war.  But when Bheeshma, considered the perfect devotee, resolved that he would either kill Arjun by sunset the next day or make the Lord lift weapons to protect him, Shree Krishna broke His own vow to protect the vow made by Bheeshma.  Thus, to reaffirm the strength of His statement, Shree Krishna here says, “Arjun, you declare that My devotee will never perish, for I shall guarantee that your word will be kept.”",how devotees considered venerable merely made correct resolve shree krishna explains continue process exclusive devotion unflinching faith god hearts become purified swiftly develop saintly virtues divine virtues emanate god himself he perfectly truthful compassionate loving merciful etc since souls his tiny parts naturally drawn godly qualities but process becoming virtuous remains elusive mystery from childhood heard must speak truth serve others free anger etc yet unable put teachings practice simple reason mind impure without purification mind blemishes character not eradicated fully permanently jagadguru shree kripaluji maharaj declares irrefutable truth regarding developing divine virtues satya ahinsā ādi mana bina hari bhajana na pāyajala te ghṛita nikale nahīñ koṭina kariya upāya bhakti śhatak verse oil stains cloth not removed water matter much try similarly truthfulness nonviolence virtuous qualities not acquired without engaging devotion god these qualities manifest mind purified purification mind not take place without attaching allpure god further shree krishna asks arjun boldly declare his devotees never perish he not say the jñānī person knowledge not lost nor he say the karmī performer rituals shall not perish he makes his promise his bhaktas devotees saying shall never come ruin thereby he reiterates he stated verse he personally carries burden maintaining depend upon him engage exclusive devotion unto himit may seem intriguing shree krishna asks arjun make statement instead declaring himself the reason special circumstances lord sometimes breaks his word he never permits his devotees word broken for example shree krishna resolved he would not lift weapons mahabharat war but bheeshma considered perfect devotee resolved would either kill arjun sunset next day make lord lift weapons protect shree krishna broke his vow protect vow made bheeshma thus reaffirm strength his statement shree krishna says arjun declare my devotee never perish i shall guarantee word kept

Hence, all those who come to know God do so by virtue of his divine grace.

Previously, he mentioned twenty emotions; now, he mentions twenty-five elevated personalities. These are the seven great Sages, the four great Saints, and the fourteen Manus. He also gives a genealogical synopsis of the universe that is born of him.Brahma was born from the Hiraṇyagarbh energy of Vishnu (the form of God that is responsible for administering the material creation). From Brahma were born the four great saints, who are Sanak, Sanandan, Sanat, Sanatan. They are also called the four Kumars. In our universe, the four Kumars are the eldest children of Brahma. Since theirs was an asexual birth from the mind of their father alone, they have no mother. Being eternally liberated souls and experts in the science of Yog, they were empowered to help others attain liberation through spiritual sādhanā. After the four Kumars, came the seven sages. These are Mareech, Angira, Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, and Vasishtha. They were empowered with the task of procreation of the human population. Then come the fourteen Manus, Svayambhuva, Swarochisha, Uttam, Tamas, Raivat, Chakshusha, Vaivasvat, Savarni, Dakshasavarni, Brahmasavarni, Dharmasavarni, Rudra-putra, Rochya, and Bhautyaka. They were empowered for the administration of humankind from the celestial abodes, and for the establishment and protection of Vedic dharma. We are presently in the era of the seventh Manu, who is called Vaivasvat Manu. This era is thus called Vaivasvat Manvantar. In the present kalp (day of Brahma), there will be seven more Manus.In the celestial abodes, there are many devatās who are discharging the function of maintaining the universe. All these personalities are sons and grandsons of Brahma, who in turn was born from Lord Vishnu, who in turn is a non-different expansion of Shree Krishna. Therefore, we can say that Shree Krishna is the original forefather of all forefathers (prapitāmaha).",here shree krishna continues explaining source everything exists previously mentioned twenty emotions mentions twentyfive elevated personalities these seven great sages four great saints fourteen manus he also gives genealogical synopsis universe born himbrahma born hiraṇyagarbh energy vishnu form god responsible administering material creation from brahma born four great saints sanak sanandan sanat sanatan they also called four kumars in universe four kumars eldest children brahma since asexual birth mind father alone mother being eternally liberated souls experts science yog empowered help others attain liberation spiritual sādhanā after four kumars came seven sages these mareech angira atri pulastya pulaha kratu vasishtha they empowered task procreation human population then come fourteen manus svayambhuva swarochisha uttam tamas raivat chakshusha vaivasvat savarni dakshasavarni brahmasavarni dharmasavarni rudraputra rochya bhautyaka they empowered administration humankind celestial abodes establishment protection vedic dharma we presently era seventh manu called vaivasvat manu this era thus called vaivasvat manvantar in present kalp day brahma seven manusin celestial abodes many devatās discharging function maintaining universe all personalities sons grandsons brahma turn born lord vishnu turn nondifferent expansion shree krishna therefore say shree krishna original forefather forefathers prapitāmaha

There is no doubt about this.","The word vibhūti refers to the great śhaktis (powers) of God manifesting in the universe. The word yogam refers to God’s connection with these wonderful powers. In this verse, Shree Krishna explains that when we become aware of the magnificence of the Supreme Lord and become convinced about his glory, we naturally become inclined to engage in his devotion.Knowledge of the greatness of God nourishes the love of the devotees and enhances their devotion. There is a direct relationship between knowledge and love, as the following example reveals. Let us say that your friend shows you a black pebble-like stone. You have no knowledge of its importance, and thus, you have no love for it either. Your friend says, “This is a śhāligrām, and a saintly personality has gifted it to me.” A śhāligrām is a special kind of fossil stone worshipped as a representation of Lord Vishnu. If you are aware of the significance of śhāligrāms, when you receive this knowledge that the stone is a śhāligrām, your appreciation for it will increase. Let us say your friend further adds, “Do you know it used to be worshipped five hundred years ago by the great saint, Swami Ramananda?” The moment you hear this piece of knowledge, your respect for the stone will increase further. Each time, it is the knowledge that is boosting your reverence for the stone. Similarly, proper knowledge of God enhances devotion toward him. Thus, having described God’s majestic splendors that manifest in the wondrous workings of unlimited universes, Shree Krishna states that those who become situated in this knowledge naturally become united with him through unflinching bhakti.",the word vibhūti refers great śhaktis powers god manifesting universe the word yogam refers god connection wonderful powers in verse shree krishna explains become aware magnificence supreme lord become convinced glory naturally become inclined engage devotionknowledge greatness god nourishes love devotees enhances devotion there direct relationship knowledge love following example reveals let us say friend shows black pebblelike stone you knowledge importance thus love either your friend says this śhāligrām saintly personality gifted me a śhāligrām special kind fossil stone worshipped representation lord vishnu if aware significance śhāligrāms receive knowledge stone śhāligrām appreciation increase let us say friend adds do know used worshipped five hundred years ago great saint swami ramananda the moment hear piece knowledge respect stone increase each time knowledge boosting reverence stone similarly proper knowledge god enhances devotion toward thus described god majestic splendors manifest wondrous workings unlimited universes shree krishna states become situated knowledge naturally become united unflinching bhakti
10,8,अहं सर्वस्य प्रभवो मत्त: सर्वं प्रवर्तते | इति मत्वा भजन्ते मां बुधा भावसमन्विता: ॥8॥,"I am the origin of all; everything moves on owing to Me. Realizing thus, the wise ones, filled with fervour, adore Me.","Shree Krishna begins the verse by saying ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo, meaning “I am the Supreme Ultimate Truth and the cause of all causes.” He has repeated this multiple times in the Bhagavad Gita, in verses 7.7, 7.12, 10.2-3, and 15.15. It is also strongly proclaimed in all the other scriptures. The Rig Veda states:yaṁ kāmaye taṁ taṁ ugraṁ kṛiṣhṇomi taṁ brahmāṇaṁ taṁ ṛiṣhiṁ taṁ sumedhsam(10.125.5)[v4]“I make the persons I love exceedingly mighty; I make them men or women; I make them wise sages; I make a soul empowered for the seat of Brahma.” The wise who comprehend this truth develop firm faith and worship him with loving devotion.Thus, Shree Krishna is the Supreme Lord of both the material and spiritual creations. However, administering creation is not the primary work of God. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu states:swayaṁ bhagavānera karma nahe bhāra-haraṇa(Chaitanya Charitāmṛit, Ādi Leela 4.8)[v5]“Shree Krishna does not directly involve himself in the works of creating, maintaining, and dissolving the material universes.” Shree Krishna’s primary activity is to engage in eternal loving pastimes with the liberated souls in Golok, his divine abode. For the purpose of material creation, he expands himself as Karanodakshayi Vishnu, who is also called Maha Vishnu.Maha Vishnu is thus the form of the Lord that presides over the material realm, consisting of infinite material universes. Maha Vishnu is also known as Pratham Puruṣh (first expansion of God in the material realm). He resides in the divine water of the kāraṇ (causal) ocean and manifests innumerable material universes from the pores of his body. He then expands himself to reside at the bottom of each universe as Garbhodakshayi Vishnu, who is called Dwitīya Puruṣh (second expansion of God in the material realm).From Garbhodakshayi Vishnu, Brahma is born. He guides the process of creation—creating the various gross and subtle elements of the universe, the laws of nature, the galaxies and planetary systems, the forms of life residing in them, etc. Hence, Brahma is often referred to as the creator of the universe. However, he is actually the secondary creator.Garbhodakashayi Vishnu further expands himself as Kshirodakshayi Vishnu, and resides at the top of each universe, in a place called Kṣhīra Sāgar. Kshirodakshayi Vishnu is also known as Tṛitīya Puruṣh (third expansion of God in the material realm). He resides at the top of the universe, but he also resides as the Supreme soul, in the heart of all living beings in the universe, noting their karmas, keeping an account, and giving the results at the appropriate time. He is thus known as the maintainer of the universe.All the three forms of Lord Vishnu mentioned here are non-different from Shree Krishna. Thus, in this verse, Shree Krishna states that all spiritual and material creation emanate from him. Shree Krishna is also called the Avatārī (the source of all the Avatārs). The Śhrīmad Bhāgvatam states: ete chāṁśha kalāḥ puṁsaḥ kṛiṣhṇas tu bhagavān svayam (1.3.28)[v6] “All the forms of God are the expansions, or the expansions of the expansions of Shree Krishna, who is the primordial form of God.” And so, the secondary creator Brahma prays to Shree Krishna:yasyaikaniśhvasita kālamathāvalambyajīvanti lomavilajā jagadaṇḍanāthāḥviṣhṇurmahān saihayasya kalāviśheṣhogovindamādi puruṣhaṁ tamahaṁ bhajāmi(Brahma Samhitā 5.48)[v7]“Infinite universes—each having Shankar, Brahma, and Vishnu—manifest from the pores of Maha Vishnu’s body when he breathes in, and again dissolve into him when he breathes out. I worship Shree Krishna of whom Maha Vishnu is an expansion.” Shree Krishna now goes on to explain how devotees worship him.",shree krishna begins verse saying ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo meaning i supreme ultimate truth cause causes he repeated multiple times bhagavad gita verses it also strongly proclaimed scriptures the rig veda states yaṁ kāmaye taṁ taṁ ugraṁ kṛiṣhṇomi taṁ brahmāṇaṁ taṁ ṛiṣhiṁ taṁ sumedhsam i make persons i love exceedingly mighty i make men women i make wise sages i make soul empowered seat brahma the wise comprehend truth develop firm faith worship loving devotionthus shree krishna supreme lord material spiritual creations however administering creation not primary work god chaitanya mahaprabhu states swayaṁ bhagavānera karma nahe bhāraharaṇa chaitanya charitāmṛit ādi leela shree krishna not directly involve works creating maintaining dissolving material universes shree krishna primary activity engage eternal loving pastimes liberated souls golok divine abode for purpose material creation expands karanodakshayi vishnu also called maha vishnumaha vishnu thus form lord presides material realm consisting infinite material universes maha vishnu also known pratham puruṣh first expansion god material realm he resides divine water kāraṇ causal ocean manifests innumerable material universes pores body he expands reside bottom universe garbhodakshayi vishnu called dwitīya puruṣh second expansion god material realm from garbhodakshayi vishnu brahma born he guides process various gross subtle elements universe laws nature galaxies planetary systems forms life residing etc hence brahma often referred creator universe however actually secondary creatorgarbhodakashayi vishnu expands kshirodakshayi vishnu resides top universe place called kṣhīra sāgar kshirodakshayi vishnu also known tṛitīya puruṣh third expansion god material realm he resides top universe also resides supreme soul heart living beings universe noting karmas keeping account giving results appropriate time he thus known maintainer universeall three forms lord vishnu mentioned nondifferent shree krishna thus verse shree krishna states spiritual material creation emanate shree krishna also called avatārī source avatārs the śhrīmad bhāgvatam states ete chāṁśha kalāḥ puṁsaḥ kṛiṣhṇas tu bhagavān svayam all forms god expansions expansions expansions shree krishna primordial form god and secondary creator brahma prays shree krishna yasyaikaniśhvasita kālamathāvalambyajīvanti lomavilajā jagadaṇḍanāthāḥviṣhṇurmahān saihayasya kalāviśheṣhogovindamādi puruṣhaṁ tamahaṁ bhajāmi brahma samhitā infinite shankar brahma pores maha vishnu body breathes dissolve breathes i worship shree krishna maha vishnu expansion shree krishna goes explain devotees worship
10,9,मच्चित्ता मद्गतप्राणा बोधयन्त: परस्परम् | कथयन्तश्च मां नित्यं तुष्यन्ति च रमन्ति च ॥9॥,"With minds fixed on Me, with lives dedicated to Me, enlightening each other, and always speaking of Me, they derive satisfaction and rejoice.","The nature of the mind is to become absorbed in what it likes most. Devotees of the Lord become absorbed in remembering him because they develop deep adoration for him. His devotion becomes the basis of their life, from which they derive meaning, purpose, and the strength to live. They feel it as essential to remember God as a fish feels it essential to have water.What is most dear to people’s hearts can be determined by where they dedicate their mind, body, and wealth. The Bible states: “For where your treasure is, there your heart will also be.” (Matthew 6:21)[v8]. You can see where people’s hearts are by studying their checkbooks and credit card statements. If they are spending money on fancy cars, that’s where their heart is. If they are spending on luxurious holidays, that’s what is most dear to them. If they are donating in charity to African children with AIDS, that is what absorbs their attention the most. The love of parents for their children is visible in the fact that they are willing to sacrifice their time and wealth in their welfare. Likewise, the love of the devotees manifests in their dedicating themselves to God. Shree Krishna says: mad-gata-prāṇāḥ, implying, “My devotees surrender their lives to me.”From such surrender, comes contentment. Since devotees offer the results of their activities to their beloved Lord, they see every situation as coming from him. Hence, they gladly accept both positive and negative circumstances as the will of God, and remain equipoised in both.While the devotees’ love for God is displayed in the form of the above characteristics, it also manifests on their lips. They find great relish in conversing about the glories of God, and his names, forms, virtues, pastimes, abodes, and devotees. In this way, by engaging in kīrtan (chanting) and shravaṇa (hearing) regarding the glories of God, they relish his sweetness for themselves and share it with others as well. They contribute to one another’s progress by enlightening others about divine knowledge of God (bodhayanti). Speaking and singing about the glories of God gives the devotees great satisfaction (tuṣhyanti), and delight (ramanti). In this way, they worship him through the processes of remembering, hearing, and chanting. This is the threefold bhakti comprising of shravaṇa, kīrtan, and smaraṇa. This has previously been described in the commentary on verse 9.14.Having described how his devotees worship him, Shree Krishna now explains how he responds to their devotional activities.",the nature mind become absorbed likes devotees lord become absorbed remembering develop deep adoration his devotion becomes basis life derive meaning purpose strength live they feel essential remember god fish feels essential waterwhat dear people hearts determined dedicate mind body wealth the bible states for treasure heart also be matthew you see people hearts studying checkbooks credit card statements if spending money fancy cars heart if spending luxurious holidays dear if donating charity african children aids absorbs attention the love parents children visible fact willing sacrifice time wealth welfare likewise love devotees manifests dedicating god shree krishna says madgataprāṇāḥ implying my devotees surrender lives me from surrender comes contentment since devotees offer results activities beloved lord see every situation coming hence gladly accept positive negative circumstances god remain equipoised bothwhile devotees love god displayed form characteristics also manifests lips they find great relish conversing glories god names forms virtues pastimes abodes devotees in way engaging kīrtan chanting shravaṇa hearing regarding glories god relish sweetness share others well they contribute one another progress enlightening others divine knowledge god bodhayanti speaking singing glories god gives devotees great satisfaction tuṣhyanti delight ramanti in way worship processes remembering hearing chanting this threefold bhakti comprising shravaṇa kīrtan smaraṇa this previously described commentary verse described devotees worship shree krishna explains responds devotional activities
10,10,तेषां सततयुक्तानां भजतां प्रीतिपूर्वकम् | ददामि बुद्धियोगं तं येन मामुपयान्ति ते ॥10॥,"To them who are ever devoted and worship Me with love, I grant that possession of wisdom by which they reach Me.","Divine knowledge of God is not attained by the flight of our intellect. No matter how powerful a mental machine we may possess, we have to admit the fact that our intellect is made from the material energy. Hence, our thoughts, understanding, and wisdom are confined to the material realm; God and his divine realm remain entirely beyond the scope of our corporeal intellect. The Vedas emphatically declare:yasyā mataṁ tasya mataṁ mataṁ yasya na veda saḥavijñātaṁ vijānatāṁ vijñātamavijānatām(Kenopaniṣhad 2.3)[v9]“Those who think they can understand God with their intellects have no understanding of God. Only those who think that he is beyond the scope of their comprehension truly understand him.”The Bṛihadāraṇyak Upaniṣhad states:sa eṣha neti netyātmā gṛihyoḥ (3.9.26)[v10]“One can never comprehend God by self-effort based upon the intellect.” The Ramayan states:rāma atarkya buddhi mana bānī, mata hamāra asa sunahi sayānī [v11]“Lord Ram is beyond the scope of our intellect, mind, and words.” Now, if these statements on the topic of knowing God plainly declare that it is not possible to know him, how then can God-realization be possible for anyone? Shree Krishna reveals here how knowledge of God can be gained. He says that it is God who bestows divine knowledge upon the soul, and the fortunate soul who receives his grace is able to know him. The Yajur Veda states:tasya no rāsva tasya no dhehī [v12]“Without bathing oneself in the nectar emanating from the lotus feet of God, no one can know him.” Thus, true knowledge of God is not a result of intellectual gymnastics but a consequence of divine grace. Shree Krishna also mentions in this verse that he does not choose the recipient of his grace in a whimsical manner. Rather, he bestows it upon those who unite their minds with him in devotion. He next talks about what happens when we receive divine grace.",divine knowledge god not attained flight intellect no matter powerful mental machine may possess admit fact intellect made material energy hence thoughts understanding wisdom confined material realm god divine realm remain entirely beyond scope corporeal intellect the vedas emphatically declare yasyā mataṁ tasya mataṁ mataṁ yasya na veda saḥavijñātaṁ vijānatāṁ vijñātamavijānatām kenopaniṣhad those think understand god intellects understanding god only think beyond scope comprehension truly understand him the bṛihadāraṇyak upaniṣhad states sa eṣha neti netyātmā gṛihyoḥ one never comprehend god selfeffort based upon intellect the ramayan states rāma atarkya buddhi mana bānī mata hamāra asa sunahi sayānī lord ram beyond scope intellect mind words now statements topic knowing god plainly declare not possible know godrealization possible anyone shree krishna reveals knowledge god gained he says god bestows divine knowledge upon soul fortunate soul receives grace able know the yajur veda states tasya rāsva tasya dhehī without bathing oneself nectar emanating lotus feet god one know him thus true knowledge god not result intellectual gymnastics consequence divine grace shree krishna also mentions verse not choose recipient grace whimsical manner rather bestows upon unite minds devotion he next talks happens receive divine grace
10,11,तेषामेवानुकम्पार्थमहमज्ञानजं तम: | नाशयाम्यात्मभावस्थो ज्ञानदीपेन भास्वता ॥11॥,"Out of compassion for them alone, I, residing in their hearts, destroy the darkness born of ignorance with the luminous lamp of Knowledge.","In this verse, Shree Krishna further elaborates the concept of grace. Previously, he had explained that he bestows it upon those who lovingly absorb their minds in him and make him the paramount object of their plans, thoughts, and activities. Now, he reveals what happens when someone receives his grace. He says that he destroys the darkness in their heart with the lamp of wisdom.Ignorance is often symbolized as darkness, but what is this lamp of wisdom that God talks about? At present, our senses, mind, and intellect are all material, while God is divine. Hence, we are unable to see him, hear him, know him, or be united with him. When God bestows his grace, he confers his divine Yogmaya energy upon the soul. It is also called śhuddha sattva (divine mode of goodness), which is distinct from the sattva guṇa (mode of goodness) of Maya. When we receive that śhuddha sattva energy, our sense, mind, and intellect become divine. To put it simply, by his grace, God bestows his divine senses, divine mind, and divine intellect to the soul. Equipped with these divine instruments, the soul is able to see God, hear God, know God, and be united with God. Hence, the Vedānt Darśhan states: viśheṣhānugrahaśh cha (3.4.38)[v13] “Only by God’s grace does one gain divine knowledge.” In this way, the torchlight that Shree Krishna refers to is his divine power. By the light of God’s divine power the darkness of the material energy is dispelled.",in verse shree krishna elaborates concept grace previously explained bestows upon lovingly absorb minds make paramount object plans thoughts activities now reveals happens someone receives grace he says destroys darkness heart lamp wisdomignorance often symbolized darkness lamp wisdom god talks at present senses mind intellect material god divine hence unable see hear know united when god bestows grace confers divine yogmaya energy upon soul it also called śhuddha sattva divine mode goodness distinct sattva guṇa mode goodness maya when receive śhuddha sattva energy sense mind intellect become divine to put simply grace god bestows divine senses divine mind divine intellect soul equipped divine instruments soul able see god hear god know god united god hence vedānt darśhan states viśheṣhānugrahaśh cha only god grace one gain divine knowledge in way torchlight shree krishna refers divine power by light god divine power darkness material energy dispelled

They claim that the Ultimate Reality is formless and without attributes it takes on forms and manifests as Avatārs, and thus these Avatārs are a step removed from God.

Jacobi stated: “God whom we could know would be no God.” However in this verse, Arjun states that there is after all one personality who knows God, and that is God himself.

Hence, the Vedas refer to him by the name anant (unlimited):anantaśhchātmā viśhwarūpo hyakartā(Śhwetāśhvatar Upaniṣhad 1.9)[v18]“God is infinite and manifests in innumerable forms in the universe. Although he administers the universe, he is yet the non-doer.” The Ramayan states:hari ananta hari kathā anantā [v19]“God is unlimited, and the pastimes he enacts in his unlimited Avatārs are also unlimited.” Sage Ved Vyas goes to the extent of saying:yo vā anantasya guṇānanantān anukramiṣhyan sa tu bāla-buddhiḥrajānsi bhūmer gaṇayet kathañchit kālena naivākhilaśhakti dhāmnaḥ(Bhāgavatam 11.4.2)[v20]“Those who think they can count the glories of God have a childish intellect. We may be successful in counting the specks of dust on the crest of the earth, but we can never count the unlimited glories of God.” Therefore, Shree Krishna says here that he will only be describing a small fraction of his vibhūtis.",the amar kosh ancient sanskrit dictionary widely respected defines vibhūti vibhūtir bhūtir aiśhwaryam power wealth god powers wealth unlimited actually everything unlimited he unlimited forms unlimited names unlimited abodes unlimited descensions unlimited pastimes unlimited devotees hence vedas refer name anant unlimited anantaśhchātmā viśhwarūpo hyakartā śhwetāśhvatar upaniṣhad god infinite manifests innumerable forms universe although administers universe yet nondoer the ramayan states hari ananta hari kathā anantā god unlimited pastimes enacts unlimited avatārs also unlimited sage ved vyas goes extent saying yo vā anantasya guṇānanantān anukramiṣhyan sa tu bālabuddhiḥrajānsi bhūmer gaṇayet kathañchit kālena naivākhilaśhakti dhāmnaḥ bhāgavatam those think count glories god childish intellect we may successful counting specks dust crest earth never count unlimited glories god therefore shree krishna says describing small fraction vibhūtis
10,20,अहमात्मा गुडाकेश सर्वभूताशयस्थित: | अहमादिश्च मध्यं च भूतानामन्त एव च ॥20॥,"O Gudakesa, I am the Self residing in the hearts of all beings, and I am the beginning and the middle as also the end of (all) beings.","Shree Krishna declares that he is not far from the soul—in fact he is closer than the closest. The ātmā or eternal soul is enthroned in the etheric heart of all living beings. The Vedas state: ya ātmani tiṣhṭhati [v21] “God is seated within our soul.” Seated inside, he grants the power of consciousness and eternality to the soul. If he were to subtract his power, our soul itself would become insentient and perish. We souls are thus eternal and sentient, not by our own power, but because the supremely sentient and eternal God is seated within, and is granting his powers to us. Hence, Shree Krishna declares that he is situated in the heart of all living beings.Our soul is the body of God, who is the Soul of our soul. The Bhāgavatam states:harirhi sākṣhādbhagavān śharīriṇāmātmā jhaṣhāṇāmiva toyamīpsitam(5.18.13)[v22]“God is the ātmā of the ātmā (Soul of the soul) of all living beings.” In the Bhāgavatam again, when Shukadev described how the gopīs used to leave their own children to go and see baby Shree Krishna, Parikshit asked him how this was possible:brahman parodbhave kṛiṣhṇe iyān premā kathaṁ bhavet(10.14.49)[v23]“O Brahmin, all mothers are attached to their own children. How did the gopīs develop such intense attachment to Shree Krishna, which they did not even feel toward their own child?” Shukadev replied:kṛiṣhṇamenamavehi tvamātmānamakhilātmanām(Bhāgavatam 10.14.55)[v24]“Please understand that Lord Krishna is the Supreme Soul of all living beings in the universe. For the benefit of humankind, he has appeared in a human form by his Yogmaya power.”Shree Krishna further states that he is the beginning, middle, and end of all living beings. They have emanated from him, and so he is their beginning. All life that exists in creation is sustained by his energy, and so he is the middle. And those who attain liberation go to his divine abode to live eternally with him. Hence, God is also the end of all living beings. Amongst the various definitions of God given by the Vedas, one of them is:yato vā imāni bhūtāni jāyante yena jātāni jīvanti, yatprayantyabhisaṁviśhanti(Taittirīya Upaniṣhad 3.1.1)[v25]“God is he from whom all living beings have emanated; God is he within whom all living beings are situated; God is he into whom all living beings shall unite.”",shree krishna declares not far fact closer closest the ātmā eternal soul enthroned etheric heart living beings the vedas state ya ātmani tiṣhṭhati god seated within soul seated inside grants power consciousness eternality soul if subtract power soul would become insentient perish we souls thus eternal sentient not power supremely sentient eternal god seated within granting powers us hence shree krishna declares situated heart living beingsour soul body god soul soul the bhāgavatam states harirhi sākṣhādbhagavān śharīriṇāmātmā jhaṣhāṇāmiva toyamīpsitam god ātmā ātmā soul soul living beings in bhāgavatam shukadev described gopīs used leave children go see baby shree krishna parikshit asked possible brahman parodbhave kṛiṣhṇe iyān premā kathaṁ bhavet o brahmin mothers attached children how gopīs develop intense attachment shree krishna not even feel toward child shukadev replied kṛiṣhṇamenamavehi tvamātmānamakhilātmanām bhāgavatam please understand lord krishna supreme soul living beings universe for benefit humankind appeared human form yogmaya power shree krishna states beginning middle end living beings they emanated beginning all life exists creation sustained energy middle and attain liberation go divine abode live eternally hence god also end living beings amongst various definitions god given vedas one yato vā imāni bhūtāni jāyante yena jātāni jīvanti yatprayantyabhisaṁviśhanti taittirīya upaniṣhad god living beings emanated god within living beings situated god living beings shall unite

From his first wife, Aditi, he fathered twelve celestial personalities—Dhata, Mitra, Aryama, Shakra, Varun, Amsha, Bhaga, Vivasvan, Pusha, Savita, Twashta, and Vaman. Amongst these, Vaman was the Avatar of the Supreme Lord Vishnu. Thus, Shree Krishna states that amongst the Adityas (twelve sons of Aditi), Vishnu (in the form of Vaman) reveals his opulence.Amongst luminous objects, the sun is supreme. The Ramayan states:rākāpati ṣhoṛasa uahiñ tārāgana samudāi,sakala girinha dava lāia binu rabi rāti na jāi [v26]“At night, all the lamps along with all the stars in the sky and the moon as well are together insufficient in removing the darkness of the night. But the moment the sun rises, the night gets dispelled.” That is the power of the sun, which Shree Krishna reveals as his vibhūti.Then, he comes to the night sky. There is the well-known saying, “One moon is better than a thousand stars.” Shree Krishna says that amongst all the constellations and stars in the night sky, he is the moon because it best reveals his opulence.The Puranas further relate that Sage Kashyap fathered daityas (demons) from his second wife Diti. However, apart from the daityas, Diti desired to have a son more powerful than Indra (the king of the celestial gods). So she kept her baby in her womb for a year. Indra then used a thunderbolt and split her fetus into many pieces, but it turned into many fetuses. These became the maruts, or the 49 kinds of winds that flow in the universe, doing tremendous good. The major ones amongst them are Avaha, Pravaha, Nivaha, Purvaha, Udvaha, Samvaha, and Parivaha. The chief wind, known as Parivaha, also bears the name Marichi. Shree Krishna states that his vibhūti (opulence) manifests in the wind called “Marichi.”",from puranas learn sage kashyap two aditi diti from first wife aditi fathered twelve celestial mitra aryama shakra varun amsha bhaga vivasvan pusha savita twashta vaman amongst vaman avatar supreme lord vishnu thus shree krishna states amongst adityas twelve sons aditi vishnu form vaman reveals opulenceamongst luminous objects sun supreme the ramayan states rākāpati ṣhoṛasa uahiñ tārāgana samudāi sakala girinha dava lāia binu rabi rāti na jāi at night lamps along stars sky moon well together insufficient removing darkness night but moment sun rises night gets dispelled that power sun shree krishna reveals vibhūtithen comes night sky there wellknown saying one moon better thousand stars shree krishna says amongst constellations stars night sky moon best reveals opulencethe puranas relate sage kashyap fathered daityas demons second wife diti however apart daityas diti desired son powerful indra king celestial gods so kept baby womb year indra used thunderbolt split fetus many pieces turned many fetuses these became maruts kinds winds flow universe tremendous good the major ones amongst avaha pravaha nivaha purvaha udvaha samvaha parivaha the chief wind known parivaha also bears name marichi shree krishna states vibhūti opulence manifests wind called marichi

Among the organs I am the mind, and I am the intelligence in creatures.","There are four Vedas—Ṛig Veda, Yajur Veda, Sama Veda, and Atharva Veda. Amongst these, the Sama Veda describes God’s glories as they manifest in the celestial gods, who are in charge of administering the universe. The Sāma Veda is also the most musical and is sung in praise of the Lord. It is enchanting to those who understand it and it evokes devotion amongst its listeners.Vasava is another name for Indra, the chief of the celestial gods. He is unparalleled among souls in fame, power, and rank. Only a soul with many lifetimes of pious deeds is promoted to the position of Indra. Thus, Indra reflects the resplendent glories of God.The five senses function correctly only if the mind is attentive to them. If the mind wanders away, the senses cannot function properly. For example, you hear with your ears what people say, but if your mind wanders away while they are speaking, their words are lost to you. So the mind is the king of the senses. Shree Krishna speaks of it as reflecting his power, and later in the Bhagavad Gita, he mentions it as the sixth and most important sense (verse 15.7).Consciousness is the quality of the soul that distinguishes it from insentient matter. The difference between a living person and a dead person is the presence of consciousness in the living person’s body and its absence in a dead person’s body. Consciousness exists in the soul by the divine power of God. Hence, the Vedas state: chetanaśhchetanānām (Kaṭhopaniṣhad 2.2.13)[v27] “God is the sentience in the sentient.”",there four veda yajur veda sama veda atharva veda amongst sama veda describes god glories manifest celestial gods charge administering universe the sāma veda also musical sung praise lord it enchanting understand evokes devotion amongst listenersvasava another name indra chief celestial gods he unparalleled among souls fame power rank only soul many lifetimes pious deeds promoted position indra thus indra reflects resplendent glories godthe five senses function correctly mind attentive if mind wanders away senses not function properly for example hear ears people say mind wanders away speaking words lost so mind king senses shree krishna speaks reflecting power later bhagavad gita mentions sixth important sense verse consciousness quality soul distinguishes insentient matter the difference living person dead person presence consciousness living person body absence dead person body consciousness exists soul divine power god hence vedas state chetanaśhchetanānām kaṭhopaniṣhad god sentience sentient

Amongst these, Shankar is the original form of Lord Shiv in the universe.Yakṣhas (semi-celestial beings) are beings who are very fond of acquiring wealth and hoarding it. Their leader, Kuber, is the god of wealth and the treasurer of the celestial gods. He thus reflects the vibhūti of God amongst the demons.There are eight vasus—land, water, fire, air, space, sun, moon, and stars. They constitute the gross structure of the universe. Amongst these, agni (fire) gives warmth and energy to the rest of the elements. Thus, Shree Krishna mentions it as his special manifestation.Meru is a mountain in the celestial abodes famed for its rich natural resources. It is believed to be the axis around which many heavenly bodies rotate. Shree Krishna thus speaks of it as his glory.

Brihaspati is the chief priest in heaven. He is thus the topmost of all priests. Here, Shree Krishna says that amongst priests, he is Brihaspati. However, in the Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam, verse 11.16.22, Shree Krishna states that amongst the priests he is Vashishtha. Why is he differing in the two places? This implies that we should not attach importance to the object, but to the opulence of God that manifests in that object. All the objects of glory that Shree Krishna is describing here should also be understood in the same light. It is not the object that is being emphasized, rather God’s opulence that is manifesting in it.Kartikeya, the son of Lord Shiv, who is also called Skanda, is the commander-in-chief of the celestial gods. He is thus the chief of all military commanders, and best reflects the opulence of God.

Similarly, everything that is manifest and unmanifest in the universe is the glory of God, but the prominent amongst them are singled out for mention as his opulence.Amongst the sages in the celestial planes of existence, Bhrigu is special. He possesses wisdom, glory, and devotion. Lord Vishnu holds the mark of his foot on his chest as a consequence of a divine pastime described in the Puranas in which Bhrigu tested the trinity of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiv. Shree Krishna’s glory is revealed best through him.Worshippers of God in his formless aspect like to meditate on the “Om” vibration, which is another vibhūti of God. Shree Krishna had declared previously, in verses 7.8 and 8.13, the syllable “Om” to be a sacred sound. It is the anāhat nād (the sound vibration that pervades creation). It is often present in the beginning of Vedic mantras for invoking auspiciousness. It is said that from the mono-syllable “Om” the Gayatri mantra was revealed, and from the Gayatri mantra, the Vedas were revealed.The Himalayas are a mountain range lying at the north of India. Since ages, they have inspired spiritual awe and wonder in billions of devotees. Their atmosphere, environment, and solitude are conducive to the performance of austerities for spiritual progress. Thus, many great sages reside in the Himalayas in their subtle bodies, practicing penance for their own advancement and for the benefit of humankind. And so, of the multitude of mountain ranges in this world, the Himalayas best display his opulence.Yajña is the act of dedicating ourselves to the Supreme. The simplest of all yajñas is the chanting of the holy names of God. This is called japa yajña, or the sacrifice of the devotional repetition of the divine names of God. For the practice of ritualistic yajñas, a number of rules are applicable, all of which need to be meticulously followed. However, in japa yajña, there are no rules. It can be done anywhere and at any time, and is more purifying than the other forms of yajñas. In the present age of Kali, the chanting of the names of God is even more emphasized.kalijuga kevala nāma ādhārā, sumiri sumiri nara utarahiṅ pārā (Ramayan)[v28]“In the age of Kali, the chanting and remembrance of the names of God is the most powerful means of crossing the ocean of material existence.”",while fruits flowers grow land best amongst selected exhibition similarly everything manifest unmanifest universe glory god prominent amongst singled mention opulenceamongst sages celestial planes existence bhrigu special he possesses wisdom glory devotion lord vishnu holds mark foot chest consequence divine pastime described puranas bhrigu tested trinity brahma vishnu shiv shree krishna glory revealed best himworshippers god formless aspect like meditate om vibration another vibhūti god shree krishna declared previously verses syllable om sacred sound it anāhat nād sound vibration pervades creation it often present beginning vedic mantras invoking auspiciousness it said monosyllable om gayatri mantra revealed gayatri mantra vedas revealedthe himalayas mountain range lying north india since ages inspired spiritual awe wonder billions devotees their atmosphere environment solitude conducive performance austerities spiritual progress thus many great sages reside himalayas subtle bodies practicing penance advancement benefit humankind and multitude mountain ranges world himalayas best display opulenceyajña act dedicating supreme the simplest yajñas chanting holy names god this called japa yajña sacrifice devotional repetition divine names god for practice ritualistic yajñas number rules applicable need meticulously followed however japa yajña rules it done anywhere time purifying forms yajñas in present age kali chanting names god even emphasizedkalijuga kevala nāma ādhārā sumiri sumiri nara utarahiṅ pārā ramayan in age kali chanting remembrance names god powerful means crossing ocean material existence

He is always engaged in singing the glories of God and doing divine works throughout the three worlds. He is also famous for deliberately creating quarrels and problems, and people sometimes misunderstand him to be a mischief-maker.

Indra, the king of heaven was once driven out of his celestial kingdom by a demon named Vritrasura. The demon had a boon whereby he could not be killed by any weapon known till then. In desperation, Indra approached Lord Shiv for help, who took him to Lord Vishnu. Vishnu revealed to Indra that the only weapon that could kill Vritrasura was a thunderbolt made from the bones of the sage Dadhichi. Indra then beseeched Dadhichi to make the ultimate sacrifice of laying down his life so that his bones could be used for making the thunderbolt. Dadhichi accepted the request, but desired to first go on a pilgrimage to all the holy rivers. Indra then brought together all the waters of the holy rivers to Naimisharanya, thereby allowing the sage to have his wish fulfilled without further loss of time. Dadhichi then gave up his body by the practice of yogic techniques. The thunderbolt made from his bones was then used to defeat the demon Vritrasura, allowing Indra to regain his place as the king of the celestial abodes. Shree Krishna deliberately refers to this thunderbolt here as the representation of the glory of God, preferring it above the mace and disc that are always held in the hands of Lord Vishnu.In this verse, Shree Krishna also reveals that the act of sexual intercourse is not unholy when it is performed for the sole purpose of begetting good children. Kaamdev, the god of love (cupid), is responsible for the force of attraction between the opposite sexes that facilitates the continuance of humankind through procreation. This sexual urge has its origin in God, and should not be mis-utilized for sensual enjoyment, but rather be used solely for the purpose of begetting worthy progeny.

10,32,सर्गाणामादिरन्तश्च मध्यं चैवाहमर्जुन | अध्यात्मविद्या विद्यानां वाद: प्रवदतामहम् ॥32॥,"O Arjuna, of creations I am the beginning and the end as also the middle, I am the knowledge of the Self among knowledge; of those who date I am Vada.","Earlier in the twentieth verse, Shree Krishna had stated that he is the beginning, middle, and end of all living beings. Now, he states the same for all creation, “All that is created, such as space, air, fire, water, and earth, is called sarga. I am the Creator (ādi), Maintainer (madhya), and Annihilator (anta) of these. Therefore, the processes of creation, maintenance, and dissolution can be meditated upon as my vibhūtis.”Vidyā is the education that a person acquires in relation to subjects of knowledge. The scriptures describe eighteen types of vidyās. Amongst them, fourteen are prominent:aṅgāni vedāśhchatvāro mīmānsā nyāya vistaraḥ purāṇaṁ dharmaśhāstraṁ cha vidyā hyetāśhchaturdaśhaāyurvedo dhanurvedo gāndharvaśhchaiva te trayaḥarthaśhāstraṁ chaturthaṁ tu vidyā hyaṣhṭādaśhaiva tāḥ(Viṣhṇu Purāṇ 3.6.27-28)[v29]“Śhikśhā, Kalp, Vyākaraṇ, Nirukti, Jyotiṣh, Chhanda—these are the six types of knowledge known as Vedāṅg (limbs of the Vedas). Ṛig, Yajur, Sāma, Atharva—these are the four branches of Vedic knowledge. Along with Mīmānsā, Nyāya, Dharma Śhāstra, and the Puranas, these comprise the fourteen chief vidyās.” Practice of these vidyās cultivates the intellect, deepens the knowledge, and increases awareness of the path of dharma. Additionally, the science of spirituality liberates human beings from material bondage and gives them immortality. Thus, it is superior to the previously mentioned vidyās. This is mentioned in the Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam as well: sā vidyā tanmatiryayā (Verse 4.29.49)[v30] “The best knowledge is that by which the intellect becomes attached to the lotus feet of God.”In the field of argument and logic, jalpa means to find fault with the opponent’s statements, for the sake of establishing one’s own opinion. Vitaṇḍa means to avoid proper deliberation on the truth through evasion and frivolous arguments. Vāda is the logical conclusion of the discussion. Logic is the basis for communication of ideas and establishment of truths. It is because of a universal sense of logic that knowledge can be easily cultivated, taught, and learnt in human society. The universal principles of logic are a manifestation of the power of God.",earlier twentieth verse shree krishna stated beginning middle end living beings now states creation all created space air fire water earth called sarga i creator ādi maintainer madhya annihilator anta therefore processes creation maintenance dissolution meditated upon vibhūtis vidyā education person acquires relation subjects knowledge the scriptures describe eighteen types vidyās amongst fourteen prominent aṅgāni vedāśhchatvāro mīmānsā nyāya vistaraḥ purāṇaṁ dharmaśhāstraṁ cha vidyā hyetāśhchaturdaśhaāyurvedo dhanurvedo gāndharvaśhchaiva te trayaḥarthaśhāstraṁ chaturthaṁ tu vidyā hyaṣhṭādaśhaiva tāḥ viṣhṇu purāṇ śhikśhā kalp vyākaraṇ nirukti jyotiṣh six types knowledge known vedāṅg limbs vedas ṛig yajur sāma four branches vedic knowledge along mīmānsā nyāya dharma śhāstra puranas comprise fourteen chief vidyās practice vidyās cultivates intellect deepens knowledge increases awareness path dharma additionally science spirituality liberates human beings material bondage gives immortality thus superior previously mentioned vidyās this mentioned śhrīmad bhāgavatam well sā vidyā tanmatiryayā verse the best knowledge intellect becomes attached lotus feet god in field argument logic jalpa means find fault opponent statements sake establishing one opinion vitaṇḍa means avoid proper deliberation truth evasion frivolous arguments vāda logical conclusion discussion logic basis communication ideas establishment truths it universal sense logic knowledge easily cultivated taught learnt human society the universal principles logic manifestation power god

[Dvandva: A compound of two or more words which, if not compounded, would stand in the same case and be connected by the conjunction 'and'] I Myself am the infinite time; I am the Dispenser with faces everywhere.","In Sanskrit, all letters are formed by combining a half-letter with “a.” For example, क् + अ = क (k + a = ka). Hence, the letter “a” is the most important in the Sanskrit alphabet. “A” is also the first vowel of the alphabet, and since the vowels are written before the consonants, “A” comes at the very beginning.Although Sanskrit is such an ancient language, it is highly refined and sophisticated. A common procedure in Sanskrit language is to combine words to form compound words. When, in the process of making one compound word, two or more words give up their case endings, it is called samāsa, and the resulting word is called samāsa pada, or compound word. There are primarily six kinds of samāsa: 1) dwandva, 2) bahubṛihi, 3) karm dhāray, 4) tatpuruṣh, 5) dwigu, 6) avyayī bhāv. Amongst these, dwandva is the best because both words remain prominent in it, while in the others, either one word becomes more prominent, or both words combine together to give the meaning of a third word. The dual word Radha-Krishna is an example of dwandva. Shree Krishna highlights it as his vibhūti.Creation is a magnificent act and awesome to behold. Humankind’s most sophisticated and technologically advanced inventions pale in comparison. Therefore, Lord Krishna singles out the first-born Brahma, who made the entire universe, and says that amongst creators, the creative ability of Brahma best reflects the glory of God.",in sanskrit letters formed combining halfletter a for example अ क k ka hence letter important sanskrit alphabet a also first vowel alphabet since vowels written consonants a comes beginningalthough sanskrit ancient language highly refined sophisticated a common procedure sanskrit language combine words form compound words when process making one compound word two words give case endings called samāsa resulting word called samāsa pada compound word there primarily six kinds samāsa dwandva bahubṛihi karm dhāray tatpuruṣh dwigu avyayī bhāv amongst dwandva best words remain prominent others either one word becomes prominent words combine together give meaning third word the dual word radhakrishna example dwandva shree krishna highlights vibhūticreation magnificent act awesome behold humankind sophisticated technologically advanced inventions pale comparison therefore lord krishna singles firstborn brahma made entire universe says amongst creators creative ability brahma best reflects glory god

Of the feminine (I am) fame, beauty, speech, memory, intelligence, fortitude and forbearance.","There is a phrase in English, “as sure as death.” For one who is born, death is certain. All life inevitably ends in death, and thus the phrase, “dead end.” God is not merely the force of creation; he is also the force of destruction. He devours everything in the form of death. In the cycle of life and death, those who die are born again. Shree Krishna states that he is also the generating principle of all future beings.Certain qualities are seen as adornments in the personality of women, while other qualities are viewed as especially praiseworthy in men. Ideally, a well-rounded personality is one that possesses both kinds of qualities. Here, Shree Krishna lists fame, prosperity, perfect speech, memory, intelligence, courage, and forgiveness, as virtues that make women glorious. The first three of these qualities manifest on the outside, while the next four manifest on the inside.Besides this, the progenitor of humankind Prajapati Daksha had twenty-four daughters. Five of these were considered the best of women—Kirti, Smriti, Medha, Dhriti, and Kshama. Shree was the daughter of Sage Bhrigu. Vak was the daughter of Brahma. In accordance with their respective names, these seven women are the presiding deities of the seven qualities mentioned in this verse.

Of the months, I am Marga-sirsa, and of the seasons, spring.","Earlier Shree Krishna had said that of the Vedas he is the Sāma Veda, which is rich with beautiful devotional songs. Now he says that within the Sāma Veda, he is the Brihatsama, which has an exquisite melody. It is typically sung at midnight.The Sanskrit language, like other languages, has distinctive systems of rhymes and meters for writing poetry. The poetry of the Vedas is in many meters. Amongst these, the Gayatri meter is very attractive and melodious. A famous mantra set in this meter is the Gayatri mantra. It is also a deeply meaningful prayer:bhūrbhuvaḥ swaḥ tatsaviturvareṇyaṁ bhargo devasya dhīmahi dhiyo yo naḥ prachodayāt (Rig Veda 3.62.10)[v31]“We meditate upon the Lord who is illuminating the three worlds and is worthy of our worship. He is the remover of all sins and the destroyer of ignorance. May he illumine our intellects in the proper direction.” The Gayatri mantra is a part of the sacred thread ceremony for young males, and is recited as a part of the daily rituals. The Devi Gayatri, the Rudra Gayatri, the Brahma Gayatri, the Paramhansa Gayatri, and several other Gayatri mantras are also found in the Vedas.Margsheersh is the ninth month of the Hindu calendar. It falls in November-December. The temperature at that time in India is just right—neither too hot nor too cold. The crops in the field are harvested at this time of the year. For these reasons it is often the favorite month of the people.Basant (spring season) is known as ṛitu rāja, or the king of seasons. It is a time when nature seems to be euphorically bursting forth with life. Many festivals are celebrated in spring, epitomizing the joy that pervades the atmosphere. Thus, amongst the seasons, spring manifests God’s opulence the most.",earlier shree krishna said vedas sāma veda rich beautiful devotional songs now says within sāma veda brihatsama exquisite melody it typically sung midnightthe sanskrit language like languages distinctive systems rhymes meters writing poetry the poetry vedas many meters amongst gayatri meter attractive melodious a famous mantra set meter gayatri mantra it also deeply meaningful prayer bhūrbhuvaḥ swaḥ tatsaviturvareṇyaṁ bhargo devasya dhīmahi dhiyo yo naḥ prachodayāt rig veda we meditate upon lord illuminating three worlds worthy worship he remover sins destroyer ignorance may illumine intellects proper direction the gayatri mantra part sacred thread ceremony young males recited part daily rituals the devi gayatri rudra gayatri brahma gayatri paramhansa gayatri several gayatri mantras also found vedasmargsheersh ninth month hindu calendar it falls novemberdecember the temperature time india hot cold the crops field harvested time year for reasons often favorite month peoplebasant spring season known ṛitu rāja king seasons it time nature seems euphorically bursting forth life many festivals celebrated spring epitomizing joy pervades atmosphere thus amongst seasons spring manifests god opulence

I am excellence, I am effort, I am the sattva quality of those possessed of sattva.","Shree Krishna mentions not only virtue but also vice as his opulence. Gambling is a dangerous vice that ruins families, businesses, and lives. It was Yudhishthir’s weakness for gambling that led to the Mahabharat war. But if gambling is also God’s glory, then is there no harm in it, and why is it forbidden?The answer is that God grants his power to the soul, and along with it, he gives the freedom of choice. If we choose to forget him, he gives us the power to forget. This is just as electric power can be used both to heat and cool a house. The user is free to choose how to utilize the power. However, the powerhouse that supplies the energy is not responsible for either the use or misuse of the power. Similarly, a gambler too possesses intellect and ability that is supplied by God. But if he decides to misuse these God-given gifts, then God is not responsible for the sinful deeds.Everyone likes victory; it reveals the glory of the Lord. Also, Shree Krishna has laid great emphasis on the quality of determination. It was previously mentioned in verse 2.41, 2.44, and 9.30 as well. The goodness of the virtuous is also a manifestation of God’s power. All virtues, achievements, glory, victory, and firm resolve originate from God. Instead of considering these as our own, we should see them as coming from him.",shree krishna mentions not virtue also vice opulence gambling dangerous vice ruins families businesses lives it yudhishthir weakness gambling led mahabharat war but gambling also god glory harm forbidden the answer god grants power soul along gives freedom choice if choose forget gives us power forget this electric power used heat cool house the user free choose utilize power however powerhouse supplies energy not responsible either use misuse power similarly gambler possesses intellect ability supplied god but decides misuse godgiven gifts god not responsible sinful deedseveryone likes victory reveals glory lord also shree krishna laid great emphasis quality determination it previously mentioned verse well the goodness virtuous also manifestation god power all virtues achievements glory victory firm resolve originate god instead considering see coming

Since no soul can excel the Lord, he is naturally the most glorious personality of the Vrishni dynasty. The Pandavas were the five sons of Pandu—Yudhishthir, Bheem, Arjun, Nakul, and Sahadev. Amongst them, Arjun was an archer par-excellence, and was a very intimate devotee of Shree Krishna. He looked upon the Lord as his dear friend.Ved Vyas is special amongst the sages. He is also known by the names “Badarayan” and “Krishna Dwaipayan.” He revealed Vedic knowledge in various ways and wrote many scriptures for the welfare of the people. In fact, Ved Vyas was an Avatār of Shree Krishna himself and is mentioned in the list of Avatārs in the Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam.Shukracharya was a very learned sage known for his expertise in the science of ethics.

And of things secret, I am verily silence; I am knowledge of the men of knowledge.","Human nature is such that mere sermons are not sufficient for ensuring good behavior amongst people. Punishment, when meted out in a timely and just manner, is an important tool for reforming sinful behavior in people and training them in right conduct. One of its goals is meant to deter those in society that might be inclined to perform wrong actions. Modern management theory describes very nicely how even one minute of proper punishment for wrong actions and one minute of suitable reward for good actions can rectify people’s behaviors.The desire for victory is universal, but those with the strength of character are not willing to sacrifice morals or ethics to achieve it. That victory which is won by the path of righteousness signifies the power of God.A secret is that which is hidden from public knowledge for a specific purpose. There is a saying in English, “A secret known to one person is a secret; a secret known to two people is no longer a secret; and a secret known to three people is news shouted out to the rest of the world.” Thus, the greatest secret is that which is hidden in silence.True wisdom comes to a person with the maturing of spiritual knowledge through self or God realization. A person endowed with it develops the perspective of seeing all events, persons, and objects in the light of their relationship with God. Such wisdom purifies, fulfills, satisfies, and elevates one. It gives direction to life, the strength to cope with its vicissitudes, and determination to persevere till the end is reached.

Efficient cause means that he is the creator who performs the work involved in manifesting the world. Material cause means that he is the material from which creation happens. In verses 7.10 and 9.18, Shree Krishna declared himself as “the eternal seed.” Again here, he states that he is “the generating seed.” He is stressing that he is the origin of everything, and without his potency nothing can exist.Living beings are born in four ways: Aṇḍaj—born from eggs, such as birds, snakes, and lizards; Jarāyuj—born from the womb, such as humans, cows, dogs, and cats; Swedaj—born from sweat, such as lice, ticks, etc; Udbhij—sprouting from the earth, such as trees, creepers, grass, and corn.

From verses 20 to 39, he has described 82 of his infinite opulences. He now says that he has spoken only one portion (uddeśhataḥ) of the breadth of the topic (vistāraḥ).The question can be asked that if everything is the opulence of God, then what was the need of mentioning these? The answer is that Arjun had asked Shree Krishna how he should think of him, and these glories have been described in response to Arjun’s question. The mind is naturally drawn to specialties, and thus, the Lord has revealed these specialties amongst his powers. Whenever we see a special splendor manifesting anywhere, if we look on it as God’s glory, then our mind will naturally be transported to him. In the larger scheme of things, however, since God’s glories are in all things big and small, one can think of the whole world as providing innumerable examples for enhancing our devotion. A paint company in India would advertise, “Whenever you see colors think of us.” In this case, Shree Krishna’s statement is tantamount to saying, “Wherever you see a manifestation of glory, think of me.”",shree krishna concluding topic opulences from verses described infinite opulences he says spoken one portion uddeśhataḥ breadth topic vistāraḥ the question asked everything opulence god need mentioning the answer arjun asked shree krishna think glories described response arjun question the mind naturally drawn specialties thus lord revealed specialties amongst powers whenever see special splendor manifesting anywhere look god glory mind naturally transported in larger scheme things however since god glories things big small one think whole world providing innumerable examples enhancing devotion a paint company india would advertise whenever see colors think us in case shree krishna statement tantamount saying wherever see manifestation glory think

He is the infinite reservoir of beauty, glory, power, knowledge, and opulence. He is the powerhouse from where all beings and things get their splendor.

I remain sustaining this whole creation in a special way with a part (of Myself).","Shree Krishna’s statement indicates that he has already answered the question. Now, of his own accord, he wants to tell something remarkable. Having revealed many amazing aspects of his splendor, he says that the magnitude of his glory cannot be judged even from the sum total of what he has described, for the entire creation of unlimited universes is held within a fraction of his being.Why does he make a reference to a fraction of his being here? The reason is that the entire material creation consisting of unlimited universes is only one-fourth of God’s entire manifestation; the remaining three-fourths is the spiritual creation.pādo ’sya viśhwā bhūtāni tripādasyāmṛitaṁ divi (Puruṣh Sūktam Mantra 3)[v32]“This temporary world made from the material energy is but one part of the Supreme Divine Personality. The other three parts are his eternal abodes that are beyond the phenomenon of life and death.”Interestingly, Shree Krishna is in front of Arjun, within the world, yet he reveals that the entire world is within a fraction of his being. This is like the story of Ganesh and Lord Shiv. Once, Sage Narad gave Lord Shiv a very special fruit. Lord Shiv’s two children, Kartikeya and Ganesh both began demanding the fruit from him. Lord Shiv thought that if he would give it to any one of them, the other would think that their father was biased. So Lord Shiv announced a competition for his two children. Whoever circumambulated the entire universe and came back to him first would get the fruit.On hearing this, Kartikeya immediately started off to circumambulate the universe. He was athletically and powerfully built and decided to take advantage of it. In comparison, Ganesh had a plump body and felt he was handicapped in competing with his brother. So, Ganesh decided to make up for it by using his intellect. Lord Shiv and Parvati were standing there. Ganesh circumambulated them thrice, and then announced, “Father, I have done it. Please give me the fruit.” Lord Shiv, “But how have you gone around the universe? You have been with us all the while.” Ganesh said, “Father, you are God. The entire universe exists within you. If I have gone around you, I have gone around the entire universe.” Lord Shiv had to agree that his son Ganesh was very smart, and indeed he had won the competition.Just as Lord Shiv was standing in one place, and yet the entire world was contained in him, similarly, Shree Krishna announces to Arjun that the entire creation, consisting of unlimited material universes, is held within a fraction of his being.",shree krishna statement indicates already answered question now accord wants tell something remarkable having revealed many amazing aspects splendor says magnitude glory not judged even sum total described entire creation unlimited universes held within fraction beingwhy make reference fraction the reason entire material creation consisting unlimited universes onefourth god entire manifestation remaining threefourths spiritual creationpādo sya viśhwā bhūtāni tripādasyāmṛitaṁ divi puruṣh sūktam mantra this temporary world made material energy one part supreme divine personality the three parts eternal abodes beyond phenomenon life death interestingly shree krishna front arjun within world yet reveals entire world within fraction this like story ganesh lord shiv once sage narad gave lord shiv special fruit lord shiv two children kartikeya ganesh began demanding fruit lord shiv thought would give one would think father biased so lord shiv announced competition two children whoever circumambulated entire universe came back first would get fruiton hearing kartikeya immediately started circumambulate universe he athletically powerfully built decided take advantage in comparison ganesh plump body felt handicapped competing brother so ganesh decided make using intellect lord shiv parvati standing ganesh circumambulated thrice announced father i done please give fruit lord shiv but gone around universe you us while ganesh said father god the entire universe exists within if i gone around i gone around entire universe lord shiv agree son ganesh smart indeed competitionjust lord shiv standing one place yet entire world contained similarly shree krishna announces arjun entire creation consisting unlimited material universes held within fraction

Although you are present within all, you are untainted by their imperfections. Although you are the supreme controller, yet you are the non-doer and are not responsible for our actions.

However, when we tiny souls possess a personality, then why should we deny a personality to the Supreme Lord? Not only can he have a personality, but he also has the best personality, and therefore he is the Supreme Divine Personality. The difference between our personality and God’s personality is that he is not only a perfect person; he also has his impersonal all-pervading aspect, which is devoid of attributes and form.Arjun declares that he accepts the reality of Shree Krishna’s divine personality, precisely as has been described to him.

He now seeks his approval. “O Yogeshwar, I have expressed my wish. If you consider me worthy of it, then by your grace, please reveal your cosmic form to me, and show me your Yog-aiśhwarya (mystic opulence).” Yog is the science of uniting the individual soul with the Supreme soul, and those who practice this science are called yogis. The word Yogeśhwar also means “Lord of all yogis.” Since the object of attainment for all yogis is the Supreme Lord, Shree Krishna is consequently the Lord of all yogis. Previously, in verse 10.17, Arjun had addressed the Lord as “Yogi,” implying “Master of yog.” But he has now changed it to “Yogeshwar” because of his increased respect for Shree Krishna.",in previous verse arjun desired see cosmic form supreme divine personality he seeks approval o yogeshwar i expressed wish if consider worthy grace please reveal cosmic form show yogaiśhwarya mystic opulence yog science uniting individual soul supreme soul practice science called yogis the word yogeśhwar also means lord yogis since object attainment yogis supreme lord shree krishna consequently lord yogis previously verse arjun addressed lord yogi implying master yog but changed yogeshwar increased respect shree krishna

I grant you the supernatural eye; behold My Divine Yoga.,"When the Supreme Lord descends in the world, he has two kinds of forms—one is the material form that can be seen with material eyes, and the other is his divine form that can only be seen with divine vision. Thus, human beings do see him during his descension upon the earth, but they see only his material form. His divine form is not visible to their material eyes. That is the reason why souls in this material world cannot recognize God when he takes an Avatār on earth. Shree Krishna mentioned this in the ninth chapter, verse 11: “When I descend in My personal form deluded persons are unable to recognize Me. They do not know the divinity of My personality, as the Supreme Lord of all beings.” What people see is only the material form of the divine descension.The same theory applies to his cosmic form. In the previous two verses, Shree Krishna asked Arjun to see the cosmic form, but Arjun could see nothing because he had material eyes. The physical eyes are insufficient to see that universal form and the ordinary intellect is unequipped to comprehend it. Thus, Shree Krishna now says that he will grant the divine vision with which it will become possible to behold the universal form with all its majesty.The granting of spiritual vision is an act of grace by the Supreme Lord. By his grace, God adds his divine eyes to the soul’s material eyes; he adds his divine mind to the soul’s material mind; he adds his divine intellect to the soul’s material intellect. Then, equipped with the divine senses, mind, and intellect of God, the soul can see his divine form, think of it, and comprehend it.",when supreme lord descends world two kinds material form seen material eyes divine form seen divine vision thus human beings see descension upon earth see material form his divine form not visible material eyes that reason souls material world not recognize god takes avatār earth shree krishna mentioned ninth chapter verse when i descend my personal form deluded persons unable recognize me they not know divinity my personality supreme lord beings what people see material form divine descensionthe theory applies cosmic form in previous two verses shree krishna asked arjun see cosmic form arjun could see nothing material eyes the physical eyes insufficient see universal form ordinary intellect unequipped comprehend thus shree krishna says grant divine vision become possible behold universal form majestythe granting spiritual vision act grace supreme lord by grace god adds divine eyes soul material eyes adds divine mind soul material mind adds divine intellect soul material intellect then equipped divine senses mind intellect god soul see divine form think comprehend

Earlier, he had looked upon him as an intimate friend and interacted in a manner befitting a close associate. He was aware in the back of his head that Shree Krishna was God, but the love overflowing in his heart would make him forget the almighty aspect of Shree Krishna’s personality. All he would remember was that he loved his friend Shree Krishna more than anything in the world.That is the nature of love. It absorbs the mind so deeply that the devotee forgets the formal position of his Beloved Lord. And if formality is retained, then love is unable to manifest in its fullness. For example, a wife loves her husband deeply. Though he may be the governor of the state, the wife only looks upon him as her husband, and that is how she is able to interact intimately with him. If she keeps this knowledge in her head that her husband is the governor, then each time he comes by, she will be inclined to stand on her feet and pay a more ceremonial respect for him. So, the knowledge of the official position of the beloved gets immersed in the loving sentiments. The same phenomenon takes place in devotion to God.The cowherds of Braj merely viewed Shree Krishna as their bosom buddy. Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj describes their pastimes with Shree Krishna very sweetly:dekho dekho rī, gwāla bālana yārī rijhavata khela jitāya sakhana ko, ghoṛā bani bani banawārī(Prem Ras Madirā, Rasiyā Mādhuri, Pada 7)[v7]“Look at the sweetness of the loving interactions between Shree Krishna and his cowherd friends! They play games together, and when Shree Krishna loses the game, he becomes a horse by sitting on all fours and his friend rides on his back.” If the cowherd friends remembered that Shree Krishna was God, they would never have the gumption to do such a thing. And the Lord too relishes the intimacy of such interactions with his devotees in which they relate with him as a dear friend.Shree Krishna enacted the famous Goverdhan leela pastime upon the earth, in which he lifted the Goverdhan Hill on the little finger of his left hand, to protect the residents of the land of Braj from the rain caused by Indra, the king of heaven and the celestial god of rain. However, Krishna’s little cowherd associates were not impressed. In their eyes, Krishna was merely a loveable friend, and so they did not believe he could lift the hill. Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj states in continuation to the verse above:nakha dhāryo goverdhana-giri jaba, sakhana kahyo hama giridhārī (Prem Ras Madirā, Rasiyā Mādhurī, Pada 7)[v8]“When Shree Krishna lifted the Goverdhan Hill, his cowherd friends applied their sticks to the bottom of the hill, thinking that they were the actual lifters of the hill.” At the end, Indra accepted defeat and came seated on his white elephant. He apologized for having sent the torrential rain, without realizing Shree Krishna’s supreme position.Now, when the cowherd boys saw Indra, the King of heaven, coming and offering obeisance to their friend Krishna, they realized that Krishna is God. So, they began looking at him fearfully from a distance. Seeing their devotional sentiment change from friendship to awe and reverence, Shree Krishna lamented, “That loving exchange we were enjoying has vanished. They are now thinking I am God.” So by his Yogmaya power, he made them forget the significance of what they had seen, and they again felt that Shree Krishna was nothing more than their friend.Arjun was also a devotee of Shree Krishna in sakhya bhāv. He was used to relating to Shree Krishna as his friend. That is why he had agreed to having Shree Krishna as his chariot driver. If his devotion had been motivated by the fact that Shree Krishna was the Supreme Lord of all creation, Arjun would never have allowed him to do such a demeaning service. But now, seeing his infinite splendor and inconceivable opulences, his fraternal sentiment toward Shree Krishna was replaced by fear.",seeing cosmic form god changed nature arjun relationship shree krishna earlier looked upon intimate friend interacted manner befitting close associate he aware back head shree krishna god love overflowing heart would make forget almighty aspect shree krishna personality all would remember loved friend shree krishna anything worldthat nature love it absorbs mind deeply devotee forgets formal position beloved lord and formality retained love unable manifest fullness for example wife loves husband deeply though may governor state wife looks upon husband able interact intimately if keeps knowledge head husband governor time comes inclined stand feet pay ceremonial respect so knowledge official position beloved gets immersed loving sentiments the phenomenon takes place devotion godthe cowherds braj merely viewed shree krishna bosom buddy jagadguru shree kripaluji maharaj describes pastimes shree krishna sweetly dekho dekho rī gwāla bālana yārī rijhavata khela jitāya sakhana ko ghoṛā bani bani banawārī prem ras madirā rasiyā mādhuri pada look sweetness loving interactions shree krishna cowherd friends they play games together shree krishna loses game becomes horse sitting fours friend rides back if cowherd friends remembered shree krishna god would never gumption thing and lord relishes intimacy interactions devotees relate dear friendshree krishna enacted famous goverdhan leela pastime upon earth lifted goverdhan hill little finger left hand protect residents land braj rain caused indra king heaven celestial god rain however krishna little cowherd associates not impressed in eyes krishna merely loveable friend not believe could lift hill jagadguru shree kripaluji maharaj states continuation verse nakha dhāryo goverdhanagiri jaba sakhana kahyo hama giridhārī prem ras madirā rasiyā mādhurī pada when shree krishna lifted goverdhan hill cowherd friends applied sticks bottom hill thinking actual lifters hill at end indra accepted defeat came seated white elephant he apologized sent torrential rain without realizing shree krishna supreme positionnow cowherd boys saw indra king heaven coming offering obeisance friend krishna realized krishna god so began looking fearfully distance seeing devotional sentiment change friendship awe reverence shree krishna lamented that loving exchange enjoying vanished they thinking i god so yogmaya power made forget significance seen felt shree krishna nothing friendarjun also devotee shree krishna sakhya bhāv he used relating shree krishna friend that agreed shree krishna chariot driver if devotion motivated fact shree krishna supreme lord creation arjun would never allowed demeaning service but seeing infinite splendor inconceivable opulences fraternal sentiment toward shree krishna replaced fear

And yet, the vision of it has dried up the camaraderie that Arjun was previously experiencing toward Shree Krishna, and he is overcome with fear.

When Oppenheimer, who was a part of the first atom bomb project, witnessed the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he quoted this verse of Shree Krishna in the following manner: “Time…I am the destroyer of all the worlds.” Time counts and controls the lifespan of all beings. It will determine when the great personalities like Bheeshma, Dronacharya, and Karn will meet their end. It will destroy the enemy army arrayed on the battlefield even without Arjun’s participating in the fight, because the Lord wants it to happen as a part of his grand scheme for the world.

God does not need the help of a human for his work, but humans attain eternal welfare by working to fulfill God’s wish. Opportunities that come our way to accomplish something for the pleasure of the Lord are a very special blessing. It is by taking these opportunities that we attract his special grace, and achieve our permanent position as the servant of God.Shree Krishna also encourages Arjun to be his instrument by reminding him of the exceptional skills he has received in the art of archery by his grace.

Do not be afraid. Fight! You shall conquer the enemies in battle.","Many of the generals on the side of the Kauravas were heretofore undefeated in combat. Jayadrath had the boon that whoever caused his head to fall on the ground would instantly have his own head burst into pieces. Karn had a special weapon called “Śhakti” given to him by Indra, which would slay anyone against whom it was used. But it could only be used once, and so Karn had kept it to take vengeance on Arjun. Dronacharya had received the knowledge of all weapons and how to neutralize them from Parshuram, who was an Avatār of God. Bheeshma had a boon that he would only die when he chose to do so. And yet, if God wished them to die in the battle, then nothing could save them. There is a saying:vindhya na īndhana pāiye, sāgara juḍai na nīraparai upas kuber ghara, jyoṅ vipakṣha raghubīra [v11]“If Lord Ram decides to be against you, then you may live in the Vindhyachal forest, but you will not be able to get firewood to light a fire; you may be by the side of the ocean, but water will be scarce for your usage; and you may live in the house of Kuber, the god of wealth, but you will not have enough to eat.” Thus, even the biggest arrangements for security cannot avert a person’s death if God has willed it to happen. Similarly, Shree Krishna says that he has already decided the outcome, but he wishes Arjun to be the medium to accomplish it and receive the glory of the conquest as a reward for his agency. Just as devotees wish to glorify God, it is God’s nature to glorify his devotees. Hence, Shree Krishna does not wish the credit to come to him; he wishes people to say after the war, “Arjun fought so valiantly that he secured victory for the Pandavas.”In spiritual life too, aspirants often become discouraged when they find themselves incapable of removing the defects of anger, greed, envy, lust, pride, etc. Their Guru then encourages them, “Do not be dejected. Fight and you will conquer the enemies of your mind because God wants you to succeed. Your effort will be instrumental, while God will fashion your victory by his grace.”What was Arjun’s reaction upon hearing the Lord’s call to action? This is stated in the next verse.",many generals side kauravas heretofore undefeated combat jayadrath boon whoever caused head fall ground would instantly head burst pieces karn special weapon called śhakti given indra would slay anyone used but could used karn kept take vengeance arjun dronacharya received knowledge weapons neutralize parshuram avatār god bheeshma boon would die chose and yet god wished die battle nothing could save there saying vindhya na īndhana pāiye sāgara juḍai na nīraparai upas kuber ghara jyoṅ vipakṣha raghubīra if lord ram decides may live vindhyachal forest not able get firewood light fire may side ocean water scarce usage may live house kuber god wealth not enough eat thus even biggest arrangements security not avert person death god willed happen similarly shree krishna says already decided outcome wishes arjun medium accomplish receive glory conquest reward agency just devotees wish glorify god god nature glorify devotees hence shree krishna not wish credit come wishes people say war arjun fought valiantly secured victory pandavas in spiritual life aspirants often become discouraged find incapable removing defects anger greed envy lust pride etc their guru encourages do not dejected fight conquer enemies mind god wants succeed your effort instrumental god fashion victory grace what arjun reaction upon hearing lord call action this stated next verse

He uses the word sthāne, meaning “it is but apt.” It is but natural that the people of a kingdom who accept the sovereignty of their king delight in glorifying him. It is also natural that those who harbor enmity toward the king fear him and flee from his presence. And it is natural for the king’s retinue of ministers to be deeply devoted to him. Arjun draws a parallel to this, saying that it is only appropriate that the world glorifies their Supreme Lord, the demons become frightened of him, and the saintly personalities offer devotional prayers to him.",in verse next ten arjun eulogizes shree krishna glories various perspectives he uses word sthāne meaning apt it natural people kingdom accept sovereignty king delight glorifying it also natural harbor enmity toward king fear flee presence and natural king retinue ministers deeply devoted arjun draws parallel saying appropriate world glorifies supreme lord demons become frightened saintly personalities offer devotional prayers

O infinite One, supreme God, Abode of the Universe, You are the Immutable, being and non-being, (and) that which is Transcendental.","Justifying in four verses why the behavior mentioned in the previous verse is apt, Arjun uses the words kasmāchcha tena, meaning “why should they not.” Why shouldn’t all living beings offer their humble respects to the Supreme Lord, when the entire creation emanates from him, is sustained by him, and shall merge back into him? He is everything that is manifest in creation because it is all his energy. He is also everything that remains unmanifest because it is his latent energy. And yet he is beyond both the manifest and the unmanifest because he is the Supreme Energetic—the source and Supreme Master of all the energies. Hence, neither the material energy nor the souls can ever do anything to impact his personality, which is transcendental to both.Arjun specifically mentions that Shree Krishna is greater than the secondary creator Brahma because Brahma is the senior most in the universe. All living beings are either Brahma’s progeny, or the descendants of his progeny.

You are the knower as also the object of knowledge, and the supreme Abode. O You of infinite forms, the Universe is pervaded by You!","Arjun addresses Shree Krishna as the original Divine Person, the cause of all causes. Every object and every personality has a cause, or a source, from which it came into being. Even Lord Vishnu has a cause. Although he is also a form of God, he is an expansion of Shree Krishna. However, Shree Krishna is not the expansion of any personality. He is the causeless first cause of everything that exists. Hence, Brahma prays to him:īśhwaraḥ paramaḥ kṛiṣhaṇaḥ sachchidānanda vigrahaḥanādirādi govindaḥ sarva kāraṇa kāraṇam (Brahma Samhitā 5.1)[v12]“Shree Krishna is the original form of the Supreme Lord. His personality is full of knowledge and Bliss. He is the origin of all, but he is without origin. He is the cause of all causes.”Shree Krishna is omniscient—the knower of everything. Further, he is also the object of all knowledge. The Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam (4.29.49) states: sā vidyā tanmatir yayā [v13]“True knowledge is that which helps us know God.” Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj states:jo hari sevā hetu ho, soī karm bakhānjo hari bhagati baṛhāve, soī samujhiya jñāna (Bhakti Śhatak verse 66)[v14]“Whatever work is done in the service of God, know that truly to be karm.

Similarly, the celestial gods have their distinct personalities and unique set of duties to discharge in the administration of the world. However, the same one God sitting in all of them manifests the special powers they possess.Consider another example. Varieties of ornaments are made from gold. They all have their distinct individuality, and yet they are all gold. So, just as gold is not an ornament, but ornaments are golden, likewise God is all the devatās but the devatās are not God.

The father is always senior to the son. Shree Krishna is the father of the father… of all the fathers that exist. Similarly, he is the spiritual master of the spiritual master… of all the spiritual masters that are present. The first spiritual master was the creator Brahma, who passed on the knowledge to his disciple, and so on. However, Brahma received the Vedic knowledge from Shree Krishna. The Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam (1.1.1) states: tene brahma hṛidāya ādi kavaye [v20] “Shree Krishna imparted Vedic knowledge into the heart of the first-born Brahma.” Thus, he is the supreme spiritual master.The Śhwetāśhvatar Upaniṣhad states:na tatsamaśhchābhyadhikaśh cha dṛiśhyate (6.8)[v21]“Nobody is equal to God, nor is anyone superior to him.” Realizing Shree Krishna to be that same Supreme Lord of the Vedas, Arjun is declaring the above attributes regarding him.",arjun says shree krishna greatest senior the father always senior son shree krishna father fathers exist similarly spiritual master spiritual spiritual masters present the first spiritual master creator brahma passed knowledge disciple however brahma received vedic knowledge shree krishna the śhrīmad bhāgavatam states tene brahma hṛidāya ādi kavaye shree krishna imparted vedic knowledge heart firstborn brahma thus supreme spiritual masterthe śhwetāśhvatar upaniṣhad states na tatsamaśhchābhyadhikaśh cha dṛiśhyate nobody equal god anyone superior him realizing shree krishna supreme lord vedas arjun declaring attributes regarding

While interacting with Shree Krishna—playing, eating, jesting, talking, and resting—he did not show the respect that is appropriate toward the Supreme Almighty. However, no one minds transgressions when they are made because of a high level of intimacy shared with the other person. No government officer has the privilege to joke with the President of a country. Yet, the President’s personal friend, teases him, jests with him, and even scolds him. The President does not mind, rather he values that jest of an intimate friend more than all the respect he receives from his subordinate officers. Thousands of people salute an army general, but they are not as dear to his heart as his wife, who sits intimately by his side. Similarly, Arjun’s intimate dealings with Shree Krishna were not transgressions; they were gestures of the depth of his loving devotion in the sentiment of being a friend. Yet, a devotee is by nature humble, and so, out of humility, he feels that he may have committed transgressions, and hence he is asking for forgiveness.",considering behavior transgressions toward god arjun asking pardon while interacting shree eating jesting talking not show respect appropriate toward supreme almighty however one minds transgressions made high level intimacy shared person no government officer privilege joke president country yet president personal friend teases jests even scolds the president not mind rather values jest intimate friend respect receives subordinate officers thousands people salute army general not dear heart wife sits intimately side similarly arjun intimate dealings shree krishna not transgressions gestures depth loving devotion sentiment friend yet devotee nature humble humility feels may committed transgressions hence asking forgiveness

O Lord, show me that very form; O supreme God, O Abode of the Universe, be gracious!","There are two kinds of bhakti—aiśhwarya bhakti and mādhurya bhakti. Aiśhwarya bhakti is that where the devotee is motivated to engage in devotion by contemplating upon the almighty aspect of God. The dominant sentiment in aiśhwarya bhakti is of awe and reverence. In such devotion, the feeling of remoteness from God and the need for maintaining propriety of conduct is always perceived. Examples of aiśhwarya bhakti are the residents of Dwaraka and the residents of Ayodhya, who worshipped Shree Krishna and Lord Ram respectively as their kings. Ordinary citizens are highly respectful and obedient toward their king, although they never feel intimate with him.Mādhurya bhakti is that where the devotee feels an intimate personal relationship with God. The dominant sentiment in such devotion is “Shree Krishna is mine and I am his.” Examples of mādhurya bhakti are the cowherd boys of Vrindavan who loved Krishna as their friend, Yashoda and Nand baba, who loved Krishna as their child, and the gopīs who loved him as their beloved. Mādhurya bhakti is infinitely sweeter than aiśhwarya bhakti. Hence, Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj states:sabai sarasa rasa dwārikā, mathurā aru braja māhiñmadhura, madhuratara, madhuratama, rasa brajarasa sama nāhiñ (Bhakti Śhatak verse 70)[v22]“The divine bliss of God is immensely sweet in all his forms. Yet, there is a gradation in it—the bliss of his Dwaraka pastimes is sweet, the bliss of his Mathura pastimes is sweeter, and the bliss of his Braj pastimes is the sweetest.”In Mādhurya bhakti, forgetting the almightiness of God, devotees establish four kinds of relationships with Shree Krishna:Dāsya bhāv—Shree Krishna is our Master and I am his servant. The devotion of Shree Krishna’s personal servants, such as Raktak, Patrak, etc. was in dāsya bhāv. The sentiment that God is our Father or Mother is a variation of dāsya bhāv and is included in it.Sakhya bhāv—Shree Krishna is our Friend and I am his intimate companion. The devotion of the cowherd boys of Vrindavan, such as Shreedama, Madhumangal, Dhansukh, Mansukh, etc. was in sakhya bhāv.Vātsalya bhāv—Shree Krishna is our Child and I am his parent. The devotion of Yashoda and Nand baba was in vātsalya bhāv.Mādhurya bhāv—Shree Krishna is our Beloved and I am his lover. The devotion of the gopīs of Vrindavan was in mādhurya bhāv.Arjun is a sakhya bhāv devotee and relishes a fraternal relationship with the Lord. On seeing the universal form of God, Arjun experienced tremendous awe and reverence, and yet he longed for the sweetness of sakhya bhāv that he was used to savoring.

Arjun has realized that Shree Krishna is much more than merely his friend. His divine personality encompasses unlimited universes. Yet, he is not attracted by the infinite opulences and is not interested in doing aiśhwarya bhakti of God Almighty. Rather, he prefers seeing that Almighty Lord in the human form, so that he can relate to him as before, like a friend. Addressing Lord Krishna as sahasra-bāho, meaning “thousand-armed one,” Arjuna is now specifically requesting to see the chatur-bhuj rūp, or four- armed form of Lord Krishna.In the four-armed form, Shree Krishna appeared before Arjun on another occasion as well. When Arjun tied Ashwatthama, the killer of the five sons of Draupadi and brought him before her, at that time Shree Krishna revealed himself in his four-armed form.niśhamya bhīma-gaditaṁ draupadyāśh cha chatur-bhujaḥālokya vadanaṁ sakhyur idam āha hasanniva (Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam 1.7.52)[v23]“The four-armed Shree Krishna heard the statements of Bheem, Draupadi, and others.

He had bestowed a vision of his universal form by his grace, not as a form of punishment, but because he was very pleased with Arjun. He uses hyperbole as a figure of speech to stress how rare it is to see the universal form, by saying that Arjun is the first one to see it. Although Duryodhan and Yashoda were also given a glimpse of the universal form, it was not to this intensity, depth, and magnitude.Shree Krishna bestowed this divine vision upon Arjun with the help of his Yogmaya energy. This is the divine all-powerful energy of God. He has referred to it in many places, such as verses 4.6 and 7.25. It is by virtue of this Yogmaya energy that God is kartumakartum anyathā karatum samarthaḥ “He can do the possible, the impossible, and the contradictory at the same time.” This divine power of God also manifests in the personal form and is worshipped in the Hindu tradition as the Divine Mother of the universe, in the form of Radha, Durga, Lakshmi, Kali, Sita, Parvati, etc.",since arjun become fearful beseeched cosmic form hidden shree krishna pacifies explaining need scared he bestowed vision universal form grace not form punishment pleased arjun he uses hyperbole figure speech stress rare see universal form saying arjun first one see although duryodhan yashoda also given glimpse universal form not intensity depth magnitudeshree krishna bestowed divine vision upon arjun help yogmaya energy this divine allpowerful energy god he referred many places verses it virtue yogmaya energy god kartumakartum anyathā karatum samarthaḥ he possible impossible contradictory time this divine power god also manifests personal form worshipped hindu tradition divine mother universe form radha durga lakshmi kali sita parvati etc

This is only possible by his divine grace. This has been repeatedly stated in the Vedas as well:tasya no hrāsva tasya no dhehi (Yajur Veda)[v24]“Without being anointed in the nectar of the grace of the Supreme Lord, nobody can see him.”The logic behind this is very straightforward. Our physical eyes are made from matter, and hence all that we can see is also material. The Supreme Lord is non-material—he is divine. To have a vision of his divine form we need divine eyes. When God bestows his grace upon the soul, he adds his divine power to our material eyes, and only then can we see him.One may ask that how was Sanjay also able to see that cosmic form, which Arjun saw by divine grace. The Mahabharat states that Sanjay also received by the grace of his Guru, Ved Vyas, who was an Avatār of God. Before the war, the Ved Vyas offered his student Sanjay divine vision so that he may be able to communicate the details of the war to Dhritarashtra. Hence, he saw the same cosmic form that Arjun saw. But later, when Duryodhan died, Sanjay was overwhelmed with grief and lost his divine vision.",shree krishna declares amount study vedic texts performance ritualistic ceremonies undertaking severe austerities abstinence food generous acts sufficient bestow vision cosmic form god this possible divine grace this repeatedly stated vedas well tasya hrāsva tasya dhehi yajur veda without anointed nectar grace supreme lord nobody see him the logic behind straightforward our physical eyes made matter hence see also material the supreme lord divine to vision divine form need divine eyes when god bestows grace upon soul adds divine power material eyes see himone may ask sanjay also able see cosmic form arjun saw divine grace the mahabharat states sanjay also received grace guru ved vyas avatār god before war ved vyas offered student sanjay divine vision may able communicate details war dhritarashtra hence saw cosmic form arjun saw but later duryodhan died sanjay overwhelmed grief lost divine vision

And He, the exalted One, reassured this terrified one by again becoming serene in form.","Shree Krishna hid the vision of his cosmic form, and manifested before Arjun in his four-armed form, which is adorned with a golden diadem, disc, mace, and lotus flower. It is the repository of all divine opulences such as majesty, omniscience, omnipotence, etc. The four-armed form of Shree Krishna evokes the sentiment of awe and reverence, much like the sentiments of the citizens of a kingdom toward their king. However, Arjun was a sakhā (friend) of Shree Krishna, and devotion dominated by the sentiment of awe and reverence would never satisfy him. He had played with Shree Krishna, eaten with him, confided his private secrets to him, and shared loving personal moments with him. Such blissful devotion of sakhya bhāv (devotion where God is seen as a personal friend) is infinitely sweeter than aiśhwarya bhakti (devotion where God is revered as the distant and almighty Lord). Hence, to conform to Arjun’s sentiment of devotion, Shree Krishna finally hid even his four-armed form, and transformed into his original two-armed form.Once in the forest of Vrindavan, Shree Krishna was engaging in loving pastimes with the gopīs, when he suddenly disappeared from their midst. The gopīs prayed for him to come back. Hearing their supplications, he manifested again, but in his four-armed form. The gopīs thought him to be the Supreme Lord Vishnu, and accordingly they paid their obeisance. But they moved on, not being attracted to spend any further time with him. They had been habituated to seeing the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna as their soul-beloved, and this form of his as Lord Vishnu held no attraction for them.

Earlier, in verse 11.48, he had stated that his universal form can be seen only by devotion. Now, in this verse, Shree Krishna emphatically declares that his two-armed form as he is standing before Arjun can only be realized through bhakti. This has been repeatedly stated in the Vedic scriptures:bhaktirevainaṁ nayati bhaktirevainaṁ paśhyati bhaktirevainaṁ darśhayati bhakti vaśhaḥ puruṣho bhaktireva garīyasī (Māṭhar Śhruti)[v27]“Devotion alone will unite us with God; devotion alone will help us see him; devotion alone will help us attain him; God is enslaved by true devotion, which is the best of all paths.”na sādhayati māṁ yogo na sānkhyaṁ dharma uddhavana svādhyāyas tapas tyāgo yathā bhaktir mamorjitā (Bhāgavatam 11.14.20)[v28]“Uddhav, I come under the control of my devotees and am won over by them.

11,55,मत्कर्मकृन्मत्परमो मद्भक्त: सङ्गवर्जित: | निर्वैर: सर्वभूतेषु य: स मामेति पाण्डव ॥55॥,"O son of Pandu, he who works for Me, accepts Me as the supreme Goal, is devoted to Me, is devoid of attachment and free from enmity towards all beings-he attains Me.","At the end of the ninth chapter, Shree Krishna had told Arjun to fix his mind upon him and be devoted to him. To enhance that devotion, he wished to reveal further secrets about himself, which he did in the tenth and eleventh chapters. In the previous verse, he again emphasized the supremacy of the path of devotion. Now, he concludes this chapter by highlighting five characteristics of those who are engaged in exclusive devotion:They perform all their duties for my sake.  Accomplished devotees do not divide their works into material and spiritual. They perform every work for the pleasure of God, thus consecrating every act of theirs to him. The Saint Kabir states:jahañ jahañ chalūñ karūñ parikramā, jo jo karūñ so sevājaba sovūñ karūñ daṇḍavat, jānūñ deva na dūjā [v31]“When I walk, I think I am circumambulating the Lord; when I work, I think I am serving the Lord; and when I sleep, I think I am offering him obeisance. In this manner, I perform no activity other than that which is offered to him.”They depend upon me. Those who rely upon their spiritual practices to reach God are not exclusively dependent upon him. That is because he is attained by his grace, and not by spiritual practice. His exclusive devotees do not even rely upon their devotion as a means of attaining him. Rather, they place their entire faith his grace alone, and see their devotion as merely a way of attracting divine grace.They are devoted to me. The devotees do not feel the need for performing any of the other spiritual practices, such as cultivation of the knowledge of Sānkhya, practice of aṣhṭāṅg yog, performance of fire sacrifices, etc. In this way, they feel that their relationship is with God alone. They behold only their Beloved Lord pervading all objects and personalities.They are free of attachment. Devotion requires the engagement of the mind. This is only possible if the mind is detached from the world. So exclusive devotees are free from all worldly attachments and repose their mind in God alone.They are without malice toward all beings. If the heart fills up with malice, it will again not remain exclusive toward God. Thus, exclusive devotees do not harbor any malice, even toward those who have harmed them. Instead, thinking that God resides in the heart of all beings, they see all actions as stemming from him and so they forgive even their wrongdoers.",at end ninth chapter shree krishna told arjun fix mind upon devoted to enhance devotion wished reveal secrets tenth eleventh chapters in previous verse emphasized supremacy path devotion now concludes chapter highlighting five characteristics engaged exclusive devotion they perform duties sake accomplished devotees not divide works material spiritual they perform every work pleasure god thus consecrating every act the saint kabir states jahañ jahañ chalūñ karūñ parikramā jo jo karūñ sevājaba sovūñ karūñ daṇḍavat jānūñ deva na dūjā when i walk i think i circumambulating lord i work i think i serving lord i sleep i think i offering obeisance in manner i perform activity offered him they depend upon those rely upon spiritual practices reach god not exclusively dependent upon that attained grace not spiritual practice his exclusive devotees not even rely upon devotion means attaining rather place entire faith grace alone see devotion merely way attracting divine gracethey devoted the devotees not feel need performing spiritual practices cultivation knowledge sānkhya practice aṣhṭāṅg yog performance fire sacrifices etc in way feel relationship god alone they behold beloved lord pervading objects personalitiesthey free attachment devotion requires engagement mind this possible mind detached world so exclusive devotees free worldly attachments repose mind god alonethey without malice toward beings if heart fills malice not remain exclusive toward god thus exclusive devotees not harbor malice even toward harmed instead thinking god resides heart beings see actions stemming forgive even wrongdoers
12,1,अर्जुन उवाच | एवं सततयुक्ता ये भक्तास्त्वां पर्युपासते | ये चाप्यक्षरमव्यक्तं तेषां के योगवित्तमा: ॥1॥,"Arjuna said: Those devotees who, being thus ever dedicated, meditate on You, and those again (who meditate) on the Immutable, the Unmanifested-of them, who are the best experiencers of yoga [(Here) yoga means samadhi, spiritual absorption.] ?","In the last chapter, Arjun saw the cosmic form of the Lord, which encompasses the entire universe.  Having seen it, he preferred to behold God in His personal form, with Attributes, Qualities, and Pastimes.  So, he is now curious regarding who are more perfect—the devotees who worship the personal form of God or those who worship the impersonal Brahman. Arjun’s question once again confirms that God has both aspects—the all-pervading formless Brahman and the personal form.  Those who say that God cannot possess a personal form limit Him, and those who say that God only exists in a personal form also limit Him.  God is perfect and complete, and so He is both formless and possessing forms.  We individual souls too have both aspects to our personality.  The soul is formless, and yet it has taken on a body, not once, but innumerable times, in countless past lifetimes.  If we tiny souls have the ability to possess a form, can the all-powerful God not possess a form whenever He wishes?  Even the great proponent of the path of jñāna-yog, Jagadguru Shankaracharya, stated:mūrtaṁ chaivāmūrtaṁ dwe eva brahmaṇo rūpe, ityupaniṣhat tayorvā dwau bhaktau bhagavadupadiṣhṭau, kleṣhādakleśhādwā muktisyāderatayormadhye“The Supreme entity is both personal and impersonal.  Practitioners of the spiritual path are also of two kinds—devotees of the formless Brahman, and devotees of the personal form.  But the path of worshipping the formless is very difficult.”",in last chapter arjun saw cosmic form lord encompasses entire universe having seen preferred behold god his personal form attributes qualities pastimes so curious regarding devotees worship personal form god worship impersonal brahman arjun question confirms god allpervading formless brahman personal form those say god not possess personal form limit him say god exists personal form also limit him god perfect complete he formless possessing forms we individual souls aspects personality the soul formless yet taken body not innumerable times countless past lifetimes if tiny souls ability possess form allpowerful god not possess form whenever he wishes even great proponent path jñānayog jagadguru shankaracharya stated mūrtaṁ chaivāmūrtaṁ dwe eva brahmaṇo rūpe ityupaniṣhat tayorvā dwau bhaktau bhagavadupadiṣhṭau kleṣhādakleśhādwā muktisyāderatayormadhye the supreme entity personal impersonal practitioners spiritual path also two formless brahman devotees personal form but path worshipping formless difficult
12,2,श्रीभगवानुवाच | मय्यावेश्य मनो ये मां नित्ययुक्ता उपासते | श्रद्धया परयोपेतास्ते मे युक्ततमा मता: ॥2॥,The Blessed Lord said: Those who meditate on Me by fixing their minds on Me with steadfast devotion (and) being endowed with supreme faith-they are considered to be the most perfect yogis according to Me.,"God can be realized in varying degrees of closeness.  Let us understand this through an example.  Suppose say you are standing by the railway tracks.  A train is coming from the distance, with its headlight shining.  It seems to you as if a light is approaching.  When the train comes closer, you can see a shimmering form along with the light.  Finally, when it comes and stands on the platform in front, you realize, “Oh!  It’s a train.  I can see all these people sitting inside their compartments, and peeping out of their windows.”  The same train seemed like a light from far.  As it came closer, it appeared to have a shimmering form along with the light.  When it drew even nearer, you realized that it was a train.  The train was the same, but on being closer to it, your understanding of its different attributes such as shape, color, passengers, compartments, doors, and windows grew. Similarly, God is perfect and complete, and is the possessor of unlimited energies.  His personality is replete with divine Names, Forms, Pastimes, Virtues, Associates, and Abodes.  However, He is realized in varying levels of closeness, as the Brahman (formless all-pervading manifestation of God), the Paramātmā (the Supreme Soul seated in the heart of all living beings, distinct from the individual soul), and Bhagavān (the personal manifestation of God that descends upon the earth).  The Bhagavatam states:vadanti tat tattva vidastattvaṁ yaj-jñānamadvayambrahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śhabdyate   (1.2.11)“The knowers of the Truth have stated that there is only one Supreme Entity that manifests in three ways in the world—Brahman, Paramātmā, and Bhagavān.”  They are not three different Gods; rather, They are three manifestations of the one Almighty God.  However, Their qualities are different.  This is just as water, steam, and ice are all made from the same substance—H2O molecules—but their physical qualities are different.  If a thirsty person asks for water, and we give ice, it will not quench the thirst.  Ice and water are both the same substance but their physical properties are different.  Similarly, Brahman, Paramātmā, and Bhagavān are manifestations of the one Supreme Lord but Their qualities are different.  Brahman is the all-pervading form of God, which is everywhere.  The Śhwetāśhvatar Upaniṣhad states:eko devaḥ sarvabhūteṣhu gūḍhaḥsarvavyāpī sarvabhūtāntarātmā...(6.11)   “There is only one Supreme Entity.  He is seated in everything and everyone.”  This all-pervading aspect of the Lord is called Brahman.  It is full of eternality, knowledge, and bliss.  However in this aspect, God does not manifest His infinite qualities, enchanting personal beauty, and sweet Pastimes.  He is like a divine light that is nirguṇa (without qualities), nirvivśeṣh (without attributes), nirākār (without form). Those who follow the path of jñāna-yog worship this aspect of God.  This is a distant realization of God as a formless light, just as the train from far appeared like light.Paramātmā is the aspect of God that is seated in everyone’s hearts.  In verse 18.61, Shree Krishna states: “The Supreme Lord dwells in the hearts of all living beings, O Arjun. According to their karmas, He directs the wanderings of the souls, who are seated on a machine made of material energy.”  Residing within, God notes all our thoughts and actions, keeps an account of them, and gives the results at the appropriate time.  We may forget what we have done, but God does not.  He remembers our every thought, word, and deed, since we were born.  And not only in this life!  In endless lifetimes, wherever we went, God went along with us.  He is such a friend who never leaves us for even a moment.  This aspect of God dwelling within is the Paramātmā. The path of aṣhṭāṅg-yog, as revealed by Patanjali in the Yog Darśhan, strives to realize God seated inside, and leads to the Paramātmā realization of God.  Just as the train, which appeared as light from far, was seen as a shimmering form when it came closer, similarly, the realization of the Supreme Entity as Paramātmā is a closer realization than Brahman. Bhagavān is the aspect of God that manifests with a personal form.  The Shreemad Bhagavatam states:kṛiṣhṇam enam avehi tvam ātmānam akhilātmanāmjagad-dhitāya so ’pyatra dehīvābhāti māyayā   (10.14.55)“The Supreme Lord Who is the Soul of all souls, has descended upon the earth in His personal form, as Shree Krishna, for the welfare of the world.”  In this Bhagavān aspect, God manifests all the sweetness of His Names, Forms, Qualities, Abodes, Pastimes, and Associates.  These attributes exist in Brahman and Paramātmā as well, but they remain latent, just as fire is latent in a match-stick, and only manifests when it is struck against the igniting strip of the matchbox.  Similarly, as Bhagavān, all the powers and aspects of God’s personality, which are latent in the other forms, get revealed.The path of bhakti, or devotion, leads to the realization of the Supreme Entity in His Bhagavān aspect.  This is the closest realization of God, just as the details of a train become visible when it comes and stops in front of the observer.  Hence, in verse 18.55, Shree Krishna states: “Only by loving devotion to Me does one come to know who I am in Truth.”  Thus, Shree Krishna answers Arjun’s question by clarifying that He considers the devotee of His personal form to be the highest yogi.",god realized varying degrees closeness let us understand example suppose say standing railway tracks a train coming distance headlight shining it seems light approaching when train comes closer see shimmering form along light finally comes stands platform front realize oh it train i see people sitting inside compartments peeping windows the

12,5,क्लेशोऽधिकतरस्तेषामव्यक्तासक्तचेतसाम् || अव्यक्ता हि गतिर्दु:खं देहवद्भिरवाप्यते ॥5॥,"For them who have their minds attached to the Unmanifested the struggle is greater; for, the Goal which is the Unmanifest is attained with difficulty by the embodied ones.","Having embraced worshippers of all His various manifestations into the fold, Shree Krishna again reiterates His preference for the worship of the personal form.  He surmises the worship of the impersonal Brahman by saying that it is an exceedingly challenging path that is full of tribulations.Why is the worship of the formless Brahman so difficult?  The first and foremost reason for this is that we humans possess a form ourselves and we have been habituated to interacting with forms in endless lifetimes.  Thus, while striving to love God as well, if our mind has a wonderful enchanting form to meditate upon, it can easily focus upon it and increase its attachment to the Lord.  However, in the case of the formless, the intellect cannot conceive of it, and the mind and senses have no tangible object to relate to.  So both the endeavors of meditating on God and increasing the mind’s attachment to Him become difficult.Worship of Brahman is also difficult in comparison to that of Bhagavān for another reason.  The difference in paths can be understood through the markaṭ-kiśhore nyāya (the logic of the baby) monkey, and mārjār-kiśhore nyāya (the logic of the baby kitten).  The baby monkey is responsible for holding onto her mother’s stomach; it is not helped by its mother.  When the mother monkey jumps from one branch to another, the onus of clinging tightly onto the mother is upon the baby, and if it is unable to do so, it falls.  In contrast, a kitten is very small and delicate, but the mother takes the responsibility of transporting it from one place to another, by holding the kitten from behind the neck and lifting it up.  In the analogy, the devotees of the formless can be compared to the baby monkey and the devotees of the personal form can be compared to the baby kitten.  Those who worship the formless Brahman have the onus of progressing on the path by themselves, because Brahman does not bestow grace upon them.  Brahman is not only formless, It is also without attributes.  It has been described as nirguṇa (without qualities), nirviśheṣh (without attributes), and nirākār (without form).  From this, it follows that Brahman does not manifest the quality of grace.  The jñānīs who worship God as nirguṇa, nirviśheṣh, and nirākār, have to rely entirely upon self-effort for progress.  On the other hand, the personal form of God is an ocean of compassion and mercy.  Hence, devotees of the personal form receive the help of divine support in their sādhanā.  On the basis of the protection that God bestows upon His devotees, Shree Krishna stated in verse 9.31: “O son of Kunti, declare it boldly that no devotee of Mine is ever lost.”  He confirms the same statement in the next two verses.",having embraced worshippers his various manifestations fold shree krishna reiterates his preference worship personal form he surmises worship impersonal brahman saying exceedingly challenging path full tribulationswhy worship formless brahman difficult the first foremost reason humans possess form habituated interacting forms endless lifetimes thus striving love god well mind wonderful enchanting form meditate upon easily focus upon increase attachment lord however case formless intellect not conceive mind senses tangible object relate so endeavors meditating god increasing mind attachment him become difficultworship brahman also difficult comparison bhagavān another reason the difference paths understood markaṭkiśhore nyāya logic baby monkey mārjārkiśhore nyāya logic baby kitten the baby monkey responsible holding onto mother stomach not helped mother when mother monkey jumps one branch another onus clinging tightly onto mother upon baby unable falls in contrast kitten small delicate mother takes responsibility transporting one place another holding kitten behind neck lifting in analogy devotees formless compared baby monkey devotees personal form compared baby kitten those worship formless brahman onus progressing path brahman not bestow grace upon brahman not formless it also without attributes it described nirguṇa without qualities nirviśheṣh without attributes nirākār without form from follows brahman not manifest quality grace the jñānīs worship god nirguṇa nirviśheṣh nirākār rely entirely upon selfeffort progress on hand personal form god ocean compassion mercy hence devotees personal form receive help divine support sādhanā on basis protection god bestows upon his devotees shree krishna stated verse o son kunti declare boldly devotee mine ever lost he confirms statement next two verses

12,8,मय्येव मन आधत्स्व मयि बुद्धिं निवेशय | निवसिष्यसि मय्येव अत ऊर्ध्वं न संशय: ॥8॥,Fix the mind on Me alone; in Me alone rest the intellect. There is no doubt that hereafter you will dwell in Me alone.,"Having explained that worship of the personal form is better, Shree Krishna now begins to explain how to worship Him.  He asks Arjun to do two things—fix the mind on God and also surrender the intellect to Him.  The function of the mind is to create desires, attractions, and aversions.  The function of the intellect is to think, analyze, and discriminate.The importance of the mind has been repeatedly stated in the Vedic scriptures: chetaḥ khalvasya bandhāya muktaye chātmano matamguṇeṣhu saktaṁ bandhāya rataṁ vā puṁsi muktaye(Bhagavatam 3.25.15)“Captivity in Maya and liberation from it is determined by the mind.  If it is attached to the world, one is in bondage, and if the mind is detached from the world, one gets liberated.” mana eva manuṣhyāṇāṁ kāraṇaṁ bandha mokṣhayoḥ   (Pañchadaśhī)“Bondage and liberation are decided by the state of the mind.”  Mere physical devotion is not sufficient; we must absorb the mind in thinking of God.  The reason is that without the engagement of the mind, mere sensory activity is of no value.  For example, we hear a sermon with our ears, but if the mind wanders off, we will not know what was said.  The words will fall on the ears but they will not register.  This shows that without engaging the mind the work of the senses does not count.  On the other hand, the mind is such an instrument that in it all the senses reside in the subtle form.  Thus, even without the actual sensory activity the mind experiences the perceptions of sight, smell, taste, touch, and sound.  For example, at night when we sleep our senses are inactive.  Yet while dreaming, our mind experiences the objects of all the senses.  This proves that the mind has the capacity to experience all perceptions even without the gross senses.  Therefore, while noting our karmas, God gives importance to the mental works and not the physical works of the senses. Even beyond the mind is the intellect.  We can only fix the mind upon God when we surrender our intellect to Him.  In material pursuits as well, when we face situations beyond the capability of our intellect, we take guidance from a person with superior intellect.  For example, we visit a doctor when we are sick.  We have no knowledge of medical science ourselves, and so we follow the advice of a qualified medical doctor.  The doctor checks our symptoms, looks at our medical reports, makes a diagnosis, and then prescribes the medicines.  We surrender our intellect and take the medicines according to the doctor’s prescription.  Similarly, if we are involved in a legal case, we take the help of a lawyer.  The lawyer instructs us how to handle the interrogation by the opposing lawyer.  Having no knowledge of law ourselves, we surrender our intellect and simply do as the lawyer says. In the same way, at present our intellect is subject to many defects.  Akrur, who went to get Shree Krishna from Vrindavan to Mathura, described these imperfections of the intellect in the Bhagavatam (10.40.25):  anityānātma duḥkheṣhu viparyaya matirhyaham  Akrur said: “Our intellect is strapped with wrong knowledge.  Though we are eternal souls, we think of ourselves to be the perishable body.  Although all the objects of the world are perishable, we think they will always remain with us, and hence, we busily accumulate them day and night.  And though the pursuit of sensual pleasures only results in misery in the long run, we still chase them in the hope that we will find happiness.”  The above three defects of the intellect are called viparyaya, or reversals of knowledge under material illusion.  The gravity of our problem is further aggravated because our intellect is habituated to this kind of defective thinking from innumerable previous lifetimes.  If we run our lives in accordance with the directions of our intellect, we will definitely not make much progress on the divine path.  Thus, if we wish to achieve spiritual success by attaching the mind to God, we must surrender our intellect to Him and follow His directions.  Surrendering the intellect means to think in accordance with the knowledge received from God via the medium of the scriptures and the bonafide Guru.  The characteristics of a surrendered intellect are described in verse 18.62.",having explained worship personal form better shree krishna begins explain worship him he asks arjun two mind god also surrender intellect him the function mind create desires attractions aversions the function intellect think analyze

By undertaking works for Me as well, you will attain perfection. [Identity with Brahman.]","The instruction to practice to remember God is also often easier said than done.  The mind is made from the material energy Maya and it naturally runs toward the material objects of the world, while taking it toward God requires conscious and determined effort.  We may hear the instruction that we should think of God, and we may desire to implement it, but when we get absorbed in our work, God slips out of the mind.  So what should those people do who find it difficult to practice the remembrance of God at all times of the day?  Shree Krishna answers this question in the above verse.Those who cannot constantly remember God should practice to simply work for Him.  In whatever work they perform, they should cultivate the intention that they are doing it for the pleasure of the Lord, as stated previously in verses 9.27 and 9.28.  In household life, a major portion of one’s time goes in the maintenance of the family.  One should keep doing the same work, but change the internal consciousness.  Rather than doing it out of bodily attachment for them, one should develop the consciousness that the family members are all children of God, and one has a responsibility to take care of them for His pleasure.  One has to continue earning one’s living, but again, a modification can be done in the consciousness with which one works.  Rather than thinking that it is for the purpose of earning money for worldly enjoyment, one can think, “I wish to maintain my family and myself with the earnings to enable us all to engage in devotion.  And whatever I can save, I will donate in the service of God.”  Similarly, the bodily processes of eating, sleeping, bathing, etc. cannot be given up.  But here again, we can develop divine consciousness, “I need to keep my body healthy so that I can serve God with it.  That is why I will carefully do the tasks required for its maintenance.”  When we practice working for the pleasure of God, we will naturally stop engaging in selfish activities and move toward those that are more in the nature of devotional service.  In this way, by performing all actions for the exclusive satisfaction of the Supreme Lord Krishna, our mind will become steady and we will soon be able to focus upon Him.  Then, gradually love for God will manifest within the heart, and we will gain success in constantly thinking of Him.",the instruction practice remember god also often easier said done the mind made material energy maya naturally runs toward material objects world taking toward god requires conscious determined effort we may hear instruction think god may desire implement get absorbed work god slips mind so people find difficult practice remembrance god times day shree krishna answers question versethose not constantly remember god practice simply work him in whatever work perform cultivate intention pleasure lord stated previously verses in household life major portion one time goes maintenance family one keep work change internal consciousness rather bodily attachment one develop consciousness family members children god one responsibility take care his pleasure one continue earning one living modification done consciousness one works rather thinking purpose earning money worldly enjoyment one think i wish maintain family earnings enable us engage devotion and whatever i save i donate service god similarly bodily processes eating sleeping bathing etc not given but develop divine consciousness i need keep body healthy i serve god that i carefully tasks required maintenance when practice working pleasure god naturally stop engaging selfish activities move toward nature devotional service in way performing actions exclusive satisfaction supreme lord krishna mind become steady soon able focus upon him then gradually love god manifest within heart gain success constantly thinking him

tantamount to harboring envy toward God Himself.  So the devotees are free from malice even toward those who are inimical toward them.Friendly and compassionate.  Devotion engenders the feeling of

self-effacement.  Proficient devotees naturally become humble and eliminate pride and proprietorship from their personality, as well as the false identification of being the body.Equipoised in

So accomplished devotees refuse to harbor unforgiving thoughts in all circumstances and leave the task of punishing wrongdoers upon God.Ever contented.  Contentment comes not from increasing our possessions, but by decreasing our wants.  Devotees no longer look upon material objects as the source of pleasure, and thus are content with whatever they get. Steadily united with Me in devotion.  As explained previously, “Yog” means union.  Devotees are yogis because their consciousness is absorbed in God.  This absorption is not occasional or intermittent, but steady and constant because they

12,15,यस्मान्नोद्विजते लोको लोकान्नोद्विजते च य: | हर्षामर्षभयोद्वेगैर्मुक्तो य: स च मे प्रिय: ॥15॥,"He, too, owing to whom the world is not disturbed, and who is not disturbed by the world, who is free from joy, impatience, fear and anxiety, is dear to Me.","The soul is by nature pure and uncontaminated.  The problem is that it is presently covered by the impure mind.  Once these impurities are removed, the glorious qualities of the soul naturally shine forth.  The Shreemad Bhagavatam states:yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavatyakiñchanāsarvair guṇais tatra samāsate surāḥharāvabhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇāmanorathenāsati dhāvato bahiḥ(5.18.12)“All the wonderful qualities of the celestial gods manifest in those who devote themselves to the Supreme Lord.  But those who do not engage in devotion only keep running on the chariot of their mind (no matter how many self-transformational techniques they may practice).”  Here, Shree Krishna describes some more qualities that develop in His devotees. Not a source of annoyance to anyone.  Devotion melts and softens the heart, and so the devotees naturally become gentle in their dealings with everyone.  Besides, they behold God seated in everyone and see all as His tiny fragments.  Therefore, they can never think of harming anyone.Not agitated by anyone.  Though devotees never hurt others, it does not mean that others do not try to hurt them.  The history of saints around the world reveals that during their lifetime those who felt threatened by their welfare work and principles often oppressed them.  However, the saints always maintained a compassionate attitude even toward the inimical.  Thus, we see how Jesus of Nazareth prayed on the cross, “Father, forgive them for they know not what they do.”  (Luke 23.34)Equal in pleasure and pain.  Devotees are equipped with the wisdom of the scriptures, and hence, they are aware that pleasure and pain are both inevitable with the flow of life, just like the passing summer and winter seasons.  Hence, with their inexhaustible positive attitude, they see the grace of God in both, and utilize all situations to enhance their devotion.Free from fear and anxiety.  The cause of fear and anxiety is attachment.  It makes us yearn for the object of attachment and fear separation from it.  The moment we become detached from material objects, we become fearless.  The devotees are not only free from attachment; they also are in harmony with the will of God.  Hence, they experience neither fear nor anxiety.",the soul nature pure uncontaminated the problem presently covered impure mind once impurities removed glorious qualities soul naturally shine forth the shreemad bhagavatam states yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavatyakiñchanāsarvair guṇais tatra samāsate surāḥharāvabhaktasya kuto mahadguṇāmanorathenāsati dhāvato bahiḥ all wonderful qualities celestial gods manifest devote supreme lord but not engage devotion keep running chariot mind matter many selftransformational techniques may practice here shree krishna describes qualities develop his devotees not source annoyance anyone devotion melts softens heart devotees naturally become gentle dealings everyone besides behold god seated everyone see his tiny fragments therefore never think harming anyonenot agitated anyone though devotees never hurt others not mean others not try hurt the history saints around world reveals lifetime felt threatened welfare work principles often oppressed however saints always maintained compassionate attitude even toward inimical thus see jesus nazareth prayed cross father forgive know not do luke equal pleasure pain devotees equipped wisdom scriptures hence aware pleasure pain inevitable flow life like passing summer winter seasons hence inexhaustible positive attitude see grace god utilize situations enhance devotionfree fear anxiety the cause fear anxiety attachment it makes us yearn object attachment fear separation the moment become detached material objects become fearless the devotees not free attachment also harmony god hence experience neither fear anxiety
12,16,अनपेक्ष: शुचिर्दक्ष उदासीनो गतव्यथ: | सर्वारम्भपरित्यागी यो मद्भक्त: स मे प्रिय: ॥16॥,"He who has no desires, who is pure, who is dextrous, who is impartial, who is free from fear, who has renounced every undertaking-he who is (such) a devotee of Mine is dear to Me.","Indifferent to worldly gains.  To a very poor person, the loss or gain of $100 would be an important matter, but a multi-billionaire would consider it insignificant and not give any further thought to it.  Devotees are rich in divine love for God and they consider it to be the highest treasure worthy of possessing.  They also give the highest priority to the loving service of the Lord.  Hence, they become unconcerned about worldly gains. Externally and internally pure.  Since their minds are constantly absorbed in the all-pure Lord, devotees become internally cleansed from the defects of lust, anger, greed, envy, ego, etc.  In this state of mind, they naturally prefer to keep the external body and environment pure as well.  Thus, in accordance with the old saying, “Cleanliness is next to Godliness,” they are also externally pure.  Skillful.  Devotees look on all their tasks as opportunities to serve God.  Hence, they perform their works with great care and attention.  This naturally makes them skillful. Without cares.  Having faith that God is always protecting them in accordance with their surrender, they become without care. Untroubled.  Since devotees are surrendered to the will of God, they simply put in their best effort in all endeavors, but leave the results in the hands of the Supreme.  Thus, whatever the outcome, they remain untroubled, subjugating their will to the divine will.  Free from selfishness in all undertakings.  Their attitude of service makes them rise above petty selfishness.",indifferent worldly gains to poor person loss gain would important matter multibillionaire would consider insignificant not give thought devotees rich divine love god consider highest treasure worthy possessing they also give highest priority loving service lord hence become unconcerned worldly gains externally internally pure since minds constantly absorbed allpure lord devotees become internally cleansed defects lust anger greed envy ego etc in state mind naturally prefer keep external body environment pure well thus accordance old saying cleanliness next godliness also externally pure skillful devotees look tasks opportunities serve god hence perform works great care attention this naturally makes skillful without cares having faith god always protecting accordance surrender become without care untroubled since devotees surrendered god simply put best effort endeavors leave results hands supreme thus whatever outcome remain untroubled subjugating divine free selfishness undertakings their attitude service makes rise petty selfishness
12,17,यो न हृष्यति न द्वेष्टि न शोचति न काङ् क्षति | शुभाशुभपरित्यागी भक्तिमान्य: स मे प्रिय: ॥17॥,"He who does not rejoice, does not fret, does not lament, does not hanker; who gives up good and bad, who is filled with devotion-he is dear to Me.","They neither rejoice in mundane pleasures nor despair in worldly sorrows.  If we are in the dark and someone offers help by showing a lamp, we naturally rejoice.  Then, if someone blows out the flame, we feel annoyed.  But if we are standing under the noonday sun, we feel indifferent whether someone shows us a lamp or another blows it out.  Similarly, the devotees of the Lord, being gratified with the divine love bliss of the God, rise above pleasure and despair. Neither lament for any loss nor hanker for any gain.  Such devotees neither hanker after pleasant worldly situations nor grieve in unpleasant ones.  The Nārad Bhakti Darśhan states:yatprāpya na kiñchidvāñchhati, na śhochati, na dveṣhṭi, na ramate, notsāhi bhavati (Sūtra 5)“On attaining divine love for God, the devotees neither yearn for pleasant things nor grieve on losing them.  They are not hateful of those who harm them.  They have no liking for worldly enjoyments.  They are not anxious for the enhancement of their worldly position.”  Devotees relish the bliss of God, so the bliss of all material objects seems insignificant in comparison.Renounce both good and evil actions.  Devotees obviously renounce evil actions (vikarm), for they are against their nature and displeasing to God.  The good actions Shree Krishna refers to are prescribed ritualistic duties (karm) mentioned in the scriptures.  All actions performed by the devotees become akarm (inaction) because they are not performed with any selfish motive and are dedicated to God.  The concept of akarm has been explained in great detail in verses 4.17 to 4.20. Full of devotion.  Bhaktimān means “filled with devotion.”  The nature of divine love is such that it keeps increasing for eternity.  Bhakti poets have said:  prem meñ pūrṇimā nahīñ “Unlike the moon which waxes to a limit and then wanes, divine love keeps growing without limit.”  So, the heart of the devotee contains an ocean of love for God.  Shree Krishna says that such devotees are very dear to Him.",they neither rejoice mundane pleasures despair worldly sorrows if dark someone offers help showing lamp naturally rejoice then someone blows flame feel annoyed but standing noonday sun feel indifferent whether someone shows us lamp another blows similarly devotees lord gratified divine love bliss god rise pleasure despair neither lament loss hanker gain such devotees neither hanker pleasant worldly situations grieve unpleasant ones the nārad bhakti darśhan states yatprāpya na kiñchidvāñchhati na śhochati na dveṣhṭi na ramate notsāhi bhavati sūtra on attaining divine love god devotees neither yearn pleasant things grieve losing they not hateful harm they liking worldly enjoyments they not anxious enhancement worldly position devotees relish bliss god bliss material objects seems insignificant comparisonrenounce good evil actions devotees obviously renounce evil actions vikarm nature displeasing god the good actions shree krishna refers prescribed ritualistic duties karm mentioned scriptures all actions performed devotees become akarm inaction not performed selfish motive dedicated god the concept akarm explained great detail verses full devotion bhaktimān means filled devotion the nature divine love keeps increasing eternity bhakti poets said prem meñ pūrṇimā nahīñ unlike moon waxes limit wanes divine love keeps growing without limit so heart devotee contains ocean love god shree krishna says devotees dear him
12,18,सम: शत्रौ च मित्रे च तथा मानापमानयो: | शीतोष्णसुखदु:खेषु सम: सङ्गविवर्जित: ॥18॥,"He who is the same towards friend and foe, and so also in honour and dishonour; who is the same under cold, heat, happiness and sorrow, who is free from attachment to everything.","Shree Krishna describes ten more qualities here. Alike to friend and foe.  Devotees are positively disposed toward all and are not swayed by the sentiments of enmity and friendship.  There is a beautiful story about Prahlad regarding this.  Once, his son, Virochan, got into an argument with his Guru’s son Sudhanva.  Virochan said, “I am superior to you because I am the son of a king.”  Sudhanva claimed, “I am superior because I am the son of a Ṛiṣhi.”  They were both young, and in their impetuousness, they laid bets.  Both said, “Whoever is proved superior will live while the other will have to die.”  Now, who would be the judge?  Sudhanva said to Virochan, “Your father, Prahlad, will be the judge.”  Virochan exclaimed, “Really!  But then you will complain that he has been partial.”  “No, my father, Ṛiṣhi Angira, has said that your father Prahlad is perfectly just, and will never differentiate between friend and foe.”The two boys went to Prahlad.  Virochan asked, “Father, am I superior or Sudhanva?”  Prahlad said, “Why did this question arise?”  “Father we have laid bets that whoever is proved superior will remain alive while the other will have to die.”  Prahlad smiled and said, “Your friend, Sudhanva, is superior since he is the son of your father’s Guru.”  Prahlad ordered his servants, “Take my son to the gallows and hang him.” At that moment, Sudhanva intervened.  “Wait!” he said to Prahlad, “I have a second question.  Am I superior or you?”  Prahlad replied, “I have been born in a family of demons, while you are the son of a Ṛiṣhi, who is also my Guru.  Hence, you are superior.”  Sudhanva again asked, “In that case, will you obey my instruction?”  “Yes, of course,” responded Prahlad.  “Ok, then leave Virochan,” said Sudhanva.  Prahlad instructed his servants, “Leave him,” in the same manner as he had said, “Take him to the gallows.” The celestial gods showered flowers into his court, and hailed the quality of justice that Prahlad displayed.  This attitude of justice came naturally to Prahlad because by virtue of being a perfect devotee of the Lord he was equal to friend, foe, relative, kith, kin, and outsider.Equipoised in honor and dishonor.  Shree Krishna further mentions that the devotees pay no heed to honor and dishonor.  This is just like when a person begins engaging in an illicit relationship, he or she is mindful of what others will say, but when the relationship becomes deep, then the person no longer cares about the disrepute it will bring.  Similarly, in the heart of the devotee the flame of divine love burns so brightly that worldly honor and dishonor no longer carry any importance.  Alike in cold and heat, joy and sorrow.  The devotees are equipoised in favorable and unfavorable circumstances.  They know that none of these are permanent.  They come and go like the day and the night, and so they do not consider it worth their while to take their thoughts off God and focus on either of them.  An incident from the life of Ramakrishna Paramahansa illustrates the nature of saints.  He got cancer of the throat in his old age.  People asked him to pray to Mother Kali to cure him.  He said, “My mind is absorbed in love for Mother Kali.  Why should I take it off from her and apply it to this dirty bodily cancer?  Whatever God has willed, let it happen.” Free from unfavorable association.  Associating with persons or objects is called saṅg.  There are two kinds of saṅg.  Association that takes our mind to the world is kusaṅg (unfavorable association), and that which takes our mind away from the world and toward God is called satsaṅg (favorable association).  Since devotees do not relish worldly thoughts, they naturally avoid kusaṅg and engage in satsaṅg.Take praise and reproach alike.  For those who are externally motivated, the appreciation and rejection by others is all-important.  However, devotees are internally motivated by the principles they value within themselves.  Hence, neither commendation nor denunciation by others makes any difference to them. Given to silent contemplation.  Crows and swans have diametrically opposite choices.  While crows are drawn to garbage piles, the majestic swans are attracted by tranquil lakes.  Similarly, the minds of worldly people find great relish in conversing about materialistic topics.  But the saintly devotees possess pure minds, and thus worldly talks seem as attractive to them as a pile of garbage.  This does not mean that they do not converse.  Like the swan drawn to the lakes, their minds are drawn toward topics such as the Names, Forms, Pastimes, and Glories of God.Content with whatever comes their way.  The needs of the devotees shrink to the bare necessities for maintaining the body.  Saint Kabir expresses this in his famous couplet:            mālik itanā dījiye, jāme kuṭumba samāya            maiṅ bhī bhūkhā na rahūñ, sādhu na bhūkhā jāya“O Lord, give me just enough for the bare maintenance of my family’s bodily needs, and for giving alms to the sadhu who comes to my door.”   Without attachment to the place of residence.  No earthly home can be a permanent residence for the soul, for it must necessarily be left behind at the time of death.  When the Mogul Emperor, Akbar, built his capital, Fatehpur Sikri, he put the following inscription on the main entrance gate: “The world is a bridge; cross over it but build no house on it.”  In the same vein, Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj states:            jaga meñ raho aise govinda radhey, dharmaśhālā meñ yātrī raheñ jyoñ batā de(Rādhā Govind Geet)“Live in this world as a traveler lives in a wayside inn (aware that it is to be vacated the next morning).”  Realizing the truth of this statement, devotees look on their home as only a temporary dwelling place.  Intellect is firmly fixed in Me.  Devotees have deep conviction in the supremacy of God’s position in creation and in their eternal relationship with Him.  They are also firm in their faith that if they surrender to Him lovingly, by God’s grace they will achieve the highest realization.  Hence, they neither wander from attraction-to-attraction or from path-to-path.  Shree Krishna declares such resolute devotees to be very dear to Him.",shree krishna describes ten qualities alike friend foe

13,5,ऋषिभिर्बहुधा गीतं छन्दोभिर्विविधै: पृथक् | ब्रह्मसूत्रपदैश्चैव हेतुमद्भिर्विनिश्चितै: || 5 ||,"It has been sung of in various ways by the Rshis, separately by the different kinds [The different branches of Vedic texts.] of Vedic texts, and also by the rational and convincing sentences themselves which are indicative of and lead to Brahman.","Knowledge is appealing to the intellect when it is expressed with precision and clarity, and is substantiated with sound logic.  Further, for it to be accepted as infallible, it must be confirmed on the basis of infallible authority.  The reference for validating spiritual knowledge is the Vedas. Vedas:  These are not just the name of some books; they are the eternal knowledge of God.  Whenever God creates the world, He manifests the Vedas for the benefit of the souls.  The Bṛihadāraṇyak Upaniṣhad (4.5.11) states:  niḥśhvasitamasya vedāḥ  “The Vedas manifested from the breath of God.”  They were first revealed in the heart of the first-born Brahma.  From there, they came down through the oral tradition, and hence, another name for them is Śhruti, or “knowledge received through the ear.”  At the beginning of the age of Kali, Ved Vyas, who was himself a descension of God, put down the Vedas in the form of a book, and divided the one body of knowledge into four portions—Ṛig Veda, Yajur Veda, Sāma Veda, and Atharva Veda.  Hence, he got the name Ved Vyās, or “one who divided the Vedas.”  The distinction must be borne in mind that Ved Vyas is never referred to as the composer of the Vedas but merely the one who divided them.  Hence, the Vedas are also called apauruṣheya, which means “not created by any person.”  They are respected as the infallible authority for spiritual knowledge. bhūtaṁ bhavyaṁ bhaviṣhyaṁ cha sarvaṁ vedāt prasidhyati  (Manu Smṛiti 12.97)“Any spiritual principle must be validated on the authority of the Vedas.”  To elaborate this knowledge of the Vedas, many sages wrote texts and these traditionally became included in the gamut of the Vedic scriptures because they conform to the authority of the Vedas.  Some of the important Vedic scriptures are listed below.Itihās:  These are historical texts, and are two in number, the Ramayan and the Mahabharat.  They describe the history related to two important descensions of God.  The Ramayan was written by Sage Valmiki, and describes the Leelas, or divine Pastimes, of Lord Ram.  Amazingly, it was written by Valmiki before Shree Ram actually displayed His Leelas.  The great poet Sage was empowered with divine vision, by which he could see the Pastimes Lord Ram would enact on descending in the world.  He thus put them down in 24,000 most beautifully composed Sanskrit verses of the Ramayan.  These verses also contain lessons on ideal behavior in various social roles, such as son, brother, wife, king, and married couples.  The Ramayan has also been written in many regional languages of India, thereby increasing its popularity amongst the people.  The most famous amongst these is the Hindi Ramayan, Ramcharit Manas, written by a great devotee of Lord Ram, Saint Tulsidas.The Mahabharat was written by Sage Ved Vyas.  It contains 100,000 verses and is considered the longest poem in the world.  The divine Leelas of Lord Krishna are the central theme of the Mahabharat.  It is full of wisdom and guidance related to duties in all stages of human life, and devotion to God.  The Bhagavad Gita is a portion of the Mahabharat.  It is the most popular Hindu scripture, since it contains the essence of spiritual knowledge, so beautifully described by Lord Krishna Himself.  It has been translated in many different languages of the world.  Innumerable commentaries have been written on the Bhagavad Gita.Puranas:  There are eighteen Puranas, written by Sage Ved Vyas.  Together, they contain 400,000 verses.  These describe the divine Pastimes of the various forms of God and His devotees.  The Puranas are also full of philosophic knowledge.  They discuss the creation of the universe, its annihilation and recreation, the history of humankind, the genealogy of the celestial gods and the holy sages.  The most important amongst them is the Bhāgavat Purāṇ, or the Shreemad Bhagavatam.  It was the last scripture written by Sage Ved Vyas.  In it, he mentions that in this scripture, he is going to reveal the highest dharma of pure selfless love for God.  Philosophically, the Shreemad Bhagavatam begins where the Bhagavad Gita ends.Ṣhaḍ-darśhan:  These come next in importance amongst the Vedic scriptures.  Six sages wrote six scriptures highlighting particular aspects of Hindu philosophy.  These became known as the Ṣhaḍ-darśhan, or six philosophic works.  They are:1. Mīmānsā:  Written by Maharishi (Sage) Jaimini, it describes ritualistic duties and ceremonies.2. Vedānt Darśhan:  Written by Maharishi Ved Vyas, it discusses the nature of the Absolute Truth.3. Nyāya Darśhan:  Written by Maharishi Gautam, it develops a system of logic for understanding life and the Absolute Truth.4. Vaiśheṣhik Darśhan:  Written by Maharishi Kanad, it analyses cosmology and creation from the perspective of its various elements.5. Yog Darśhan:  Written by Maharishi Patañjali, it describes an eightfold path to union with God, beginning with physical postures.6. Sānkhya Darśhan:  Written by Maharishi Kapil, it describes the evolution of the Universe from prakṛiti, the primordial form of the material energy.Apart from these mentioned above, there are hundreds of other scriptures in the Hindu tradition.  It would be impossible to describe them all here.  Let it suffice to say that the Vedic scriptures are a vast treasure house of divine knowledge revealed by God and the saints for the eternal welfare of all humankind. Amongst these scriptural texts, the Brahma Sūtra (Vedānt Darśhan) is considered as the last word on the topic of the distinction between the soul, the material body, and God.  Hence, Shree Krishna particularly mentions it in the above verse.  “Ved” refers to the Vedas, and “ant” means “the conclusion.”  Consequently, “Vedānt” means “the conclusion of Vedic knowledge.”  Although, the Vedānt Darśhan was written by Sage Ved Vyas, many great scholars accepted it as the reference authority for philosophical dissertation and wrote commentaries on it to establish their unique philosophic viewpoint regarding the soul and God.  Jagadguru Shankaracharya’s commentary on the Vedānt Darśhan is called Śhārīrak Bhāṣhya, which lays the foundation for the advait-vād tradition of philosophy.  Many of his followers, such as Vachaspati and Padmapada have elaborated upon his commentary.  Jagadguru Nimbarkarcharya wrote the Vedānt Pārijāta Saurabh, which explains the dwait-advait-vād school of thought.  Jagadguru Ramanujacharya’s commentary is called Śhrī Bhāṣhya, which lays the basis for the viśhiṣhṭ-advait-vād system of philosophy.  Jagadguru Madhvacharya’s commentary is called Brahma Sūtra Bhāṣhyam, which is the foundation for the dwait-vād school of thought.  Mahaprabhu Vallabhacharya wrote Aṇu Bhāṣhya, in which he established the śhuddhadvait-vād system of philosophy.  Apart from these, some of the other well-known commentators have been Bhat Bhaskar, Yadav Prakash, Keshav, Nilakanth, Vijnanabhikshu, and Baladev Vidyabhushan.Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, himself a Vedic scholar par excellence, did not write any commentary on the Vedānt Darśhan.  He took the view that the writer of the Vedānt, Sage Ved Vyas himself, declared that his final scripture the Shreemad Bhagavatam is its perfect commentary:arthoyaṁ brahmasūtrāṇaṁ sarvopaniṣhadāmapi“The Shreemad Bhagavatam reveals the meaning and the essence of the Vedānt Darśhan and all the Upanishads.”  Hence, out of respect for Ved Vyas, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu did not deem it fit to write another commentary on the scripture.",knowledge appealing intellect

13,7,इच्छा द्वेष: सुखं दु:खं सङ्घातश्चेतना धृति: | एतत्क्षेत्रं समासेन सविकारमुदाहृतम् ॥7॥,"Desire, repulsion, happiness, sorrow, the aggregate (of body and organs), sentience, fortitude- this field, together with its modifications, has been spoken of briefly.","Shree Krishna now elucidates the attributes of the kṣhetra (field), and its modifications thereof:Body.  The field of activities includes the body, but is much more than that.  The body undergoes six transformations until death—asti (coming into existence), jāyate (birth), vardhate (growth), viparinamate (reproduction), apakṣhīyate (withering with age), vinaśhyati (death).  The body supports the soul in its quest for happiness in the world or in God, as the soul guides it.Consciousness.  It is the life force that exists in the soul, and which it also imparts to the body while it is present in it.  This is just as fire has the ability to heat, and if we put an iron rod into it, the rod too becomes red hot with the heat it receives from the fire.  Similarly, the soul makes the body seem lifelike by imparting the quality of consciousness in it.  Shree Krishna thus includes consciousness as a trait of the field of activities.  Will.  This is the determination that keeps the constituent elements of the body active and focused in a particular direction.  It is the will that enables the soul to achieve goals through the field of activities.  The will is a quality of the intellect, which is energized by the soul.  Variations in the will due to the influence of sattva guṇa, rajo guṇa, and tamo guṇa are described in verses 18.33 to 18.35.Desire.  This is a function of the mind and the intellect, which creates a longing for the acquisition of an object, a situation, a person, etc.  In discussing the body, we would probably take desire for granted, but imagine how different the nature of life would have been if there were no desires.  So the Supreme Lord, who designed the field of activities and included desire as a part of it, naturally makes special mention of it.  The intellect analyses the desirability of an object, and the mind harbors its desire.  When one becomes self-realized, all material desires are extinguished, and now the purified mind harbors the desire for God.  While material desires are the cause of bondage, spiritual desires lead to liberation.Aversion.  It is a state of the mind and intellect that creates revulsion for objects, persons, and situations that are disagreeable to it, and seeks to avoid them.Happiness.  This is a feeling of pleasure that is experienced in the mind through agreeable circumstances and fulfillment of desires.  The mind perceives the sensations of happiness, and the soul does so along with it because it identifies with the mind.  However, material happiness never satiates the hunger of the soul, which remains discontented until it experiences the infinite divine bliss of God.Misery.  It is the pain experienced in the mind through disagreeable circumstances. Now Shree Krishna goes on to describe the virtues and attributes that will enable one to cultivate knowledge, and thereby fulfill the purpose of the field of activities, which is human form.",shree krishna elucidates attributes kṣhetra field modifications thereof body the field activities includes body much the body undergoes six transformations coming

13,8,अमानित्वमदम्भित्वमहिंसा क्षान्तिरार्जवम् | आचार्योपासनं शौचं स्थैर्यमात्मविनिग्रह: ॥8॥,"Humility, unpretentiousness, non-injury, for-bearance, sincerity, service of the teacher, cleanliness, steadiness, control of body and organs;","To gain knowledge of the kṣhetra and kṣhetrajña is not merely an intellectual exercise.  Unlike bookish knowledge that can be cultivated without a change in one’s character, the spiritual knowledge that Shree Krishna is talking about requires purification of the heart.  (Here, heart does not refer to the physical organ.  The inner apparatus of mind and intellect is also sometimes referred to as the heart.)  These five verses describe the virtues, habits, behaviors, and attitudes that purify one’s life and illuminate it with the light of knowledge.Humbleness.  When we become proud of the attributes of our individual field, such as beauty, intellect, talent, strength, etc. we forget that God has given all these attributes to us.  Pride thus results in distancing our consciousness from God.  It is a big obstacle on the path of self-realization since it contaminates the entire field by affecting the qualities of the mind and intellect.Freedom from hypocrisy.  The hypocrite develops an artificial external personality.  A person is defective from inside, but creates a facade of virtuosity on the outside.  Unfortunately, the external display of virtues is skin-deep and hollow. Non-violence.  The cultivation of knowledge requires respect for all living beings.  This requires the practice of non-violence.  Hence the scriptures state: ātmanaḥ pratikūlāni pareśhāṁ na samācharet  “If you dislike a certain behavior from others, do not behave with them in that manner yourself.” Forgiveness.  It is freedom from ill will even toward those who have harmed one.  Actually, harboring ill will harms oneself more than the other.  By practicing forgiveness, a person of discrimination releases the negativities in the mind and purifies it.Simplicity.  It is straightforwardness in thought, speech, and action.  Straightforwardness in thought includes absence of deceit, envy, crookedness, etc.  Straightforwardness in speech includes absence of taunt, censure, gossip, ornamentation, etc.  Straightforwardness in action includes plainness in living, forthrightness in behavior, etc.Service of the Guru.  Spiritual knowledge is received from the Guru.  This imparting of divine knowledge requires the disciple to have an attitude of dedication and devotion toward the Guru.  By serving the Guru, the disciple develops humbleness and commitment that enables the Guru to impart knowledge.  Thus, Shree Krishna explained to Arjun in verse 4.34:  “Learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master.  Inquire from him with reverence and render service unto him.  Such an enlightened saint can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.”Cleanliness of body and mind.  Purity should be both internal and external.  The Śhāṇdilya Upaniṣhad states:  śhauchaṁ nāma dwividhaṁ-bāhyamāntaraṁ cheti (1.1)  “There are two types of cleanliness—internal and external.”  External cleanliness is helpful in maintaining good health, developing discipline, and uncluttering the mind.  But mental cleanliness is even more important, and it is achieved by focusing the mind on the all-pure God.  Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj states:māyādhīn malīn mana, hai anādi kālīn,hari virahānala dhoya jala, karu nirmala bani dīn.   (Bhakti Śhatak verse 79)   “The material mind is dirty since endless lifetimes.  Purify it in the fire of longing for God, while practicing utmost humility.” Steadfastness.  Self-knowledge and God-realization are not goals that are attainable in a day.  Steadfastness is the persistence to remain on the path until the goal is reached.  The scriptures state:  charaivaite charaivate, charan vai madhu vindati  “Keep moving forward.  Keep moving forward.  Those who do not give up will get the honey at the end.” Self-control.  It is the restraint of the mind and the senses from running after mundane pleasures that dirty the mind and intellect.  Self-control prevents the dissipation of the personality through indulgence.Dispassion toward the objects of the senses.  It is a stage higher than the self-control mentioned above, in which we restrain ourselves by force.  Dispassion means a lack of taste for sense pleasures that are obstacles on the path of God-realization.Absence of egotism.  Egotism is the conscious awareness of “I,” “me,” and “mine.”  This is classified as nescience because it is at the bodily level, arising out of the identification of the self with the body.  It is also called the aham chetanā (pride arising out of the sense of self).  All mystics emphatically declare that to invite God into our hearts, we must get rid of the pride of the self.            jaba maiṅ thā taba hari nathīṅ, ab hari hai, maiṅ nāhīṅ            prem galī ati sankarī, yā meṅ dwe na samāhīṅ   (Saint Kabir)“When ‘I’ existed, God was not there; now God exists and ‘I’ do not.  The path of divine love is very narrow; it cannot accommodate both ‘I’ and God.” In the path of jñāna-yog and aṣhṭāṅg-yog, there are elaborate sādhanās for getting rid of the aham chetanā.  But in the path of bhakti-yog, it gets eliminated very simply.  We add dās (servant) in front of aham (the sense of self), making it dāsoham (I am the servant of God).  Now the “I” no longer remains harmful and self-consciousness is replaced by God-consciousness. Keeping in mind the evils of birth, disease, old-age and death.  If the intellect is undecided about what is more important—material enhancement or spiritual wealth—then it becomes difficult to develop the strong will required for acquiring knowledge of the self.  But when the intellect is convinced about the unattractiveness of the world, it becomes firm in its resolve.  To get this firmness, we should constantly contemplate about the miseries that are an inseparable part of life in the material world.  This is what set the Buddha on the spiritual path.  He saw a sick person, and thought, “O there is sickness in the world.  I will also have to fall sick one day.”  Then He saw an old person, and thought, “There is also old age.  This means that I will also become old one day.”  After that, He saw a dead person, and realized, “This is also a part of existence.  It means that I too will have to die one day.”  The Buddha’s intellect was so perceptive that one exposure to these facts of life made Him renounce worldly existence.  Since we do not have such decisive intellects, we must repeatedly contemplate on these facts to allow the unattractiveness of the world to sink in.Non-attachment.  It means dispassion toward the world.  We have only one mind and if we wish to engage it in pursuing spiritual goals, we have to detach it from material objects and persons.  The sādhak replaces worldly attachment with love and attachment toward God. Absence of clinging to spouse, children, home, and so on.  These are areas where the mind easily becomes attached.  In bodily thinking, one spontaneously identifies with the family and home as “mine.”  Thus, they linger upon the mind more often and attachment to them shackles the mind to material consciousness.  Attachment causes expectations of the kind of behavior we want from family members, and when these expectations are not met, it leads to mental anguish.  Also inevitably, there is separation from the family, either temporarily, if they go to another place, or permanently, if they die.  All these experiences and their apprehensions begin to weigh heavily upon the mind and drag it away from God.  Hence, if we seek immortal bliss, we must practice prudence while interacting with the spouse, child, and home, to prevent the mind from becoming entangled.  We must do our duty toward them, without attachment, as a nurse does her duty in the hospital, or as a teacher does her duty toward her students in the school. Even-mindedness amidst desired and undesired events in life.  Pleasurable and painful events come without invitation, just as the night and the day.  That is life.  To rise above these dualities, we must learn to enhance our spiritual strength through detachment toward the world.  We must develop the ability to remain unperturbed by life’s reversals and also not get carried away with the euphoria of success. Constant and exclusive devotion toward Me.  Mere detachment means that the mind is not going in the negative direction.  But life is more than merely preventing the undesirable.  Life is about engaging in the desirable.  The desirable goal of life is to consecrate it at the lotus feet of God.  Therefore, Shree Krishna has highlighted it here.Inclination for solitary places.  Unlike worldly people, devotees are not driven by the need for company to overcome feelings of loneliness.  They naturally prefer solitude that enables them to engage their mind in communion with God.  Hence, they are naturally inclined to choosing solitary places, where they are able to more deeply absorb themselves in devotional thoughts. Aversion for mundane society.  The sign of a materialistic mind is that it finds pleasure in talks about worldly people and worldly affairs.  One who is cultivating divine consciousness develops a natural distaste for these activities, and thus avoids mundane society.  At the same time, if it is necessary to participate in it for the sake of service to God, the devotee accepts it and develops the strength to remain mentally unaffected by it.Constancy in spiritual knowledge.  To theoretically know something is not enough.  One may know that anger is a bad thing but may still give vent to it repeatedly.  We have to learn to practically implement spiritual knowledge in our lives.  This does not happen by hearing profound truths just once.  After hearing them, we must repeatedly contemplate upon them.  Such mulling over the divine truths is the constancy in spiritual knowledge that Shree Krishna is talking about.Philosophical pursuit of the Absolute Truth.  Even animals engage in the bodily activities of eating, sleeping, mating, and defending.  However, God has especially blessed the human form with the faculty of knowledge.  This is not to enable us to engage in bodily activities in a deluxe way, but for us to contemplate upon the questions: “Who am I?  Why am I here?  What is my goal in life?  How was this world created?  What is my connection with the Creator?  How will I fulfill my purpose in life?”  This philosophic pursuit of the truth sublimates our thinking above the animalistic level and brings us to hear and read about the divine science of God-realization.All the virtues, habits, behaviors, and attitudes described above lead to the growth of wisdom and knowledge.  The opposite of these are vanity, hypocrisy, violence, vengeance, duplicity, disrespect for the Guru, uncleanliness of body and mind, unsteadiness, lack of self-control, longing for sense objects, conceit, entanglement in spouse, children, home, etc.  Such dispositions cripple the development self-knowledge.  Thus, Shree Krishna calls them ignorance and darkness.",to gain knowledge kṣhetra kṣhetrajña not merely intellectual exercise unlike

13,9,इन्द्रियार्थेषु वैराग्यमनहङ्कार एव च | जन्ममृत्युजराव्याधिदु:खदोषानुदर्शनम् ॥9॥,"Non-attachment with regard to objects of the senses, and also absence of egotism; seeing the evil in birth, death, old age, diseases and miseries;","To gain knowledge of the kṣhetra and kṣhetrajña is not merely an intellectual exercise.  Unlike bookish knowledge that can be cultivated without a change in one’s character, the spiritual knowledge that Shree Krishna is talking about requires purification of the heart.  (Here, heart does not refer to the physical organ.  The inner apparatus of mind and intellect is also sometimes referred to as the heart.)  These five verses describe the virtues, habits, behaviors, and attitudes that purify one’s life and illuminate it with the light of knowledge.Humbleness.  When we become proud of the attributes of our individual field, such as beauty, intellect, talent, strength, etc. we forget that God has given all these attributes to us.  Pride thus results in distancing our consciousness from God.  It is a big obstacle on the path of self-realization since it contaminates the entire field by affecting the qualities of the mind and intellect.Freedom from hypocrisy.  The hypocrite develops an artificial external personality.  A person is defective from inside, but creates a facade of virtuosity on the outside.  Unfortunately, the external display of virtues is skin-deep and hollow. Non-violence.  The cultivation of knowledge requires respect for all living beings.  This requires the practice of non-violence.  Hence the scriptures state: ātmanaḥ pratikūlāni pareśhāṁ na samācharet  “If you dislike a certain behavior from others, do not behave with them in that manner yourself.” Forgiveness.  It is freedom from ill will even toward those who have harmed one.  Actually, harboring ill will harms oneself more than the other.  By practicing forgiveness, a person of discrimination releases the negativities in the mind and purifies it.Simplicity.  It is straightforwardness in thought, speech, and action.  Straightforwardness in thought includes absence of deceit, envy, crookedness, etc.  Straightforwardness in speech includes absence of taunt, censure, gossip, ornamentation, etc.  Straightforwardness in action includes plainness in living, forthrightness in behavior, etc.Service of the Guru.  Spiritual knowledge is received from the Guru.  This imparting of divine knowledge requires the disciple to have an attitude of dedication and devotion toward the Guru.  By serving the Guru, the disciple develops humbleness and commitment that enables the Guru to impart knowledge.  Thus, Shree Krishna explained to Arjun in verse 4.34:  “Learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master.  Inquire from him with reverence and render service unto him.  Such an enlightened saint can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.”Cleanliness of body and mind.  Purity should be both internal and external.  The Śhāṇdilya Upaniṣhad states:  śhauchaṁ nāma dwividhaṁ-bāhyamāntaraṁ cheti (1.1)  “There are two types of cleanliness—internal and external.”  External cleanliness is helpful in maintaining good health, developing discipline, and uncluttering the mind.  But mental cleanliness is even more important, and it is achieved by focusing the mind on the all-pure God.  Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj states:māyādhīn malīn mana, hai anādi kālīn,hari virahānala dhoya jala, karu nirmala bani dīn.   (Bhakti Śhatak verse 79)   “The material mind is dirty since endless lifetimes.  Purify it in the fire of longing for God, while practicing utmost humility.” Steadfastness.  Self-knowledge and God-realization are not goals that are attainable in a day.  Steadfastness is the persistence to remain on the path until the goal is reached.  The scriptures state:  charaivaite charaivate, charan vai madhu vindati  “Keep moving forward.  Keep moving forward.  Those who do not give up will get the honey at the end.” Self-control.  It is the restraint of the mind and the senses from running after mundane pleasures that dirty the mind and intellect.  Self-control prevents the dissipation of the personality through indulgence.Dispassion toward the objects of the senses.  It is a stage higher than the self-control mentioned above, in which we restrain ourselves by force.  Dispassion means a lack of taste for sense pleasures that are obstacles on the path of God-realization.Absence of egotism.  Egotism is the conscious awareness of “I,” “me,” and “mine.”  This is classified as nescience because it is at the bodily level, arising out of the identification of the self with the body.  It is also called the aham chetanā (pride arising out of the sense of self).  All mystics emphatically declare that to invite God into our hearts, we must get rid of the pride of the self.            jaba maiṅ thā taba hari nathīṅ, ab hari hai, maiṅ nāhīṅ            prem galī ati sankarī, yā meṅ dwe na samāhīṅ   (Saint Kabir)“When ‘I’ existed, God was not there; now God exists and ‘I’ do not.  The path of divine love is very narrow; it cannot accommodate both ‘I’ and God.” In the path of jñāna-yog and aṣhṭāṅg-yog, there are elaborate sādhanās for getting rid of the aham chetanā.  But in the path of bhakti-yog, it gets eliminated very simply.  We add dās (servant) in front of aham (the sense of self), making it dāsoham (I am the servant of God).  Now the “I” no longer remains harmful and self-consciousness is replaced by God-consciousness. Keeping in mind the evils of birth, disease, old-age and death.  If the intellect is undecided about what is more important—material enhancement or spiritual wealth—then it becomes difficult to develop the strong will required for acquiring knowledge of the self.  But when the intellect is convinced about the unattractiveness of the world, it becomes firm in its resolve.  To get this firmness, we should constantly contemplate about the miseries that are an inseparable part of life in the material world.  This is what set the Buddha on the spiritual path.  He saw a sick person, and thought, “O there is sickness in the world.  I will also have to fall sick one day.”  Then He saw an old person, and thought, “There is also old age.  This means that I will also become old one day.”  After that, He saw a dead person, and realized, “This is also a part of existence.  It means that I too will have to die one day.”  The Buddha’s intellect was so perceptive that one exposure to these facts of life made Him renounce worldly existence.  Since we do not have such decisive intellects, we must repeatedly contemplate on these facts to allow the unattractiveness of the world to sink in.Non-attachment.  It means dispassion toward the world.  We have only one mind and if we wish to engage it in pursuing spiritual goals, we have to detach it from material objects and persons.  The sādhak replaces worldly attachment with love and attachment toward God. Absence of clinging to spouse, children, home, and so on.  These are areas where the mind easily becomes attached.  In bodily thinking, one spontaneously identifies with the family and home as “mine.”  Thus, they linger upon the mind more often and attachment to them shackles the mind to material consciousness.  Attachment causes expectations of the kind of behavior we want from family members, and when these expectations are not met, it leads to mental anguish.  Also inevitably, there is separation from the family, either temporarily, if they go to another place, or permanently, if they die.  All these experiences and their apprehensions begin to weigh heavily upon the mind and drag it away from God.  Hence, if we seek immortal bliss, we must practice prudence while interacting with the spouse, child, and home, to prevent the mind from becoming entangled.  We must do our duty toward them, without attachment, as a nurse does her duty in the hospital, or as a teacher does her duty toward her students in the school. Even-mindedness amidst desired and undesired events in life.  Pleasurable and painful events come without invitation, just as the night and the day.  That is life.  To rise above these dualities, we must learn to enhance our spiritual strength through detachment toward the world.  We must develop the ability to remain unperturbed by life’s reversals and also not get carried away with the euphoria of success. Constant and exclusive devotion toward Me.  Mere detachment means that the mind is not going in the negative direction.  But life is more than merely preventing the undesirable.  Life is about engaging in the desirable.  The desirable goal of life is to consecrate it at the lotus feet

They naturally prefer solitude that enables them to engage their mind in communion with God.  Hence, they are naturally inclined to choosing solitary places, where they are able to more deeply absorb

of life is to consecrate it at the lotus feet of God.  Therefore, Shree Krishna has highlighted it here.Inclination for solitary places.  Unlike worldly people, devotees are not driven by the need for company to overcome feelings of loneliness.  They naturally prefer solitude that enables them to engage their mind in communion with God.  Hence, they are naturally inclined to choosing solitary places, where they are able to more deeply absorb themselves in devotional thoughts. Aversion for mundane society.  The sign of a materialistic mind is that it finds pleasure in talks about worldly people and worldly affairs.  One who is cultivating divine consciousness develops a natural distaste for these activities, and thus avoids mundane society.  At the same time, if it is necessary to participate in it for the sake of service to God, the devotee accepts it and develops the strength to remain mentally unaffected by it.Constancy in spiritual knowledge.  To theoretically know something is not enough.  One may know that anger is a bad thing but may still give vent to it repeatedly.  We have to learn to practically implement spiritual knowledge in our lives.  This does not happen by hearing profound truths just once.  After hearing them, we must repeatedly contemplate upon them.  Such mulling over the divine truths is the constancy in spiritual knowledge that Shree Krishna is talking about.Philosophical pursuit of the Absolute Truth.  Even animals engage in the bodily activities of eating, sleeping, mating, and defending.  However, God has especially blessed the human form with the faculty of knowledge.  This is not to enable us to engage in bodily activities in a deluxe way, but for us to contemplate upon the questions: “Who am I?  Why am I here?  What is my goal in life?  How was this world created?  What is my connection with the Creator?  How will I fulfill my purpose in life?”  This philosophic pursuit of the truth sublimates our thinking above the animalistic level and brings us to hear and read about the divine science of God-realization.All the virtues, habits, behaviors, and attitudes described above lead to the growth of wisdom and knowledge.  The opposite of these are vanity, hypocrisy, violence, vengeance, duplicity, disrespect for the Guru, uncleanliness of body and mind, unsteadiness, lack of self-control, longing for sense objects, conceit, entanglement in spouse, children, home, etc.  Such dispositions cripple the development self-knowledge.  Thus, Shree Krishna calls them ignorance and darkness.",to gain knowledge

13,11,मयि चानन्ययोगेन भक्तिरव्यभिचारिणी | विविक्तदेशसेवित्वमरतिर्जनसंसदि ॥11॥,And unwavering devotion to Me with single-minded concentration; inclination to repair into a clean place; lack of delight in a crowd of people;,"To gain knowledge of the kṣhetra and kṣhetrajña is not merely an intellectual exercise.  Unlike bookish knowledge that can be cultivated without a change in one’s character, the spiritual knowledge that Shree Krishna is talking about requires purification of the heart.  (Here, heart does not refer to the physical organ.  The inner apparatus of mind and intellect is also sometimes referred to as the heart.)  These five verses describe the virtues, habits, behaviors, and attitudes that purify one’s life and illuminate it with the light of knowledge.Humbleness.  When we become proud of the attributes of our individual field, such as beauty, intellect, talent, strength, etc. we forget that God has given all these attributes to us.  Pride thus results in distancing our consciousness from God.  It is a big obstacle on the path of self-realization since it contaminates the entire field by affecting the qualities of the mind and intellect.Freedom from hypocrisy.  The hypocrite develops an artificial external personality.  A person is defective from inside, but creates a facade of virtuosity on the outside.  Unfortunately, the external display of virtues is skin-deep and hollow. Non-violence.  The cultivation of knowledge requires respect for all living beings.  This requires the practice of non-violence.  Hence the scriptures state: ātmanaḥ pratikūlāni pareśhāṁ na samācharet  “If you dislike a certain behavior from others, do not behave with them in that manner yourself.” Forgiveness.  It is freedom from ill will even toward those who have harmed one.  Actually, harboring ill will harms oneself more than the other.  By practicing forgiveness, a person of discrimination releases the negativities in the mind and purifies it.Simplicity.  It is straightforwardness in thought, speech, and action.  Straightforwardness in thought includes absence of deceit, envy, crookedness, etc.  Straightforwardness in speech includes absence of taunt, censure, gossip, ornamentation, etc.  Straightforwardness in action includes plainness in living, forthrightness in behavior, etc.Service of the Guru.  Spiritual knowledge is received from the Guru.  This imparting of divine knowledge requires the disciple to have an attitude of dedication and devotion toward the Guru.  By serving the Guru, the disciple develops humbleness and commitment that enables the Guru to impart knowledge.  Thus, Shree Krishna explained to Arjun in verse 4.34:  “Learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master.  Inquire from him with reverence and render service unto him.  Such an enlightened saint can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.”Cleanliness of body and mind.  Purity should be both internal and external.  The Śhāṇdilya Upaniṣhad states:  śhauchaṁ nāma dwividhaṁ-bāhyamāntaraṁ cheti (1.1)  “There are two types of cleanliness—internal and external.”  External cleanliness is helpful in maintaining good health, developing discipline, and uncluttering the mind.  But mental cleanliness is even more important, and it is achieved by focusing the mind on the all-pure God.  Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj states:māyādhīn malīn mana, hai anādi kālīn,hari virahānala dhoya jala, karu nirmala bani dīn.   (Bhakti Śhatak verse 79)   “The material mind is dirty since endless lifetimes.  Purify it in the fire of longing for God, while practicing utmost humility.” Steadfastness.  Self-knowledge and God-realization are not goals that are attainable in a day.  Steadfastness is the persistence to remain on the path until the goal is reached.  The scriptures state:  charaivaite charaivate, charan vai madhu vindati  “Keep moving forward.  Keep moving forward.  Those who do not give up will get the honey at the end.” Self-control.  It is the restraint of the mind and the senses from running after mundane pleasures that dirty the mind and intellect.  Self-control prevents the dissipation of the personality through indulgence.Dispassion toward the objects of the senses.  It is a stage higher than the self-control mentioned above, in which we restrain ourselves by force.  Dispassion means a lack of taste for sense pleasures that are obstacles on the path of God-realization.Absence of egotism.  Egotism is the conscious awareness of “I,” “me,” and “mine.”  This is classified as nescience because it is at the bodily level, arising out of the identification of the self with the body.  It is also called the aham chetanā (pride arising out of the sense of self).  All mystics emphatically declare that to invite God into our hearts, we must get rid of the pride of the self.            jaba maiṅ thā taba hari nathīṅ, ab hari hai, maiṅ nāhīṅ            prem galī ati sankarī, yā meṅ dwe na samāhīṅ   (Saint Kabir)“When ‘I’ existed, God was not there; now God exists and ‘I’ do not.  The path of divine love is very narrow; it cannot accommodate both ‘I’ and God.” In the path of jñāna-yog and aṣhṭāṅg-yog, there are elaborate sādhanās for getting rid of the aham chetanā.  But in the path of bhakti-yog, it gets eliminated very simply.  We add dās (servant) in front of aham (the sense of self), making it dāsoham (I am the servant of God).  Now the “I” no longer remains harmful and self-consciousness is replaced by God-consciousness. Keeping in mind the evils of birth, disease, old-age and death.  If the intellect is undecided about what is more important—material enhancement or spiritual wealth—then it becomes difficult to develop the strong will required for acquiring knowledge of the self.  But when the intellect is convinced about the unattractiveness of the world, it becomes firm in its resolve.  To get this firmness, we should constantly contemplate about the miseries that are an inseparable part of life in the material world.  This is what set the Buddha on the spiritual path.  He saw a sick person, and thought, “O there is sickness in the world.  I will also have to fall sick one day.”  Then He saw an old person, and thought, “There is also old age.  This means that I will also become old one day.”  After that, He saw a dead person, and realized, “This is also a part of existence.  It means that I too will have to die one day.”  The Buddha’s intellect was so perceptive that one exposure to these facts of life made Him renounce worldly existence.  Since we do not have such decisive intellects, we must repeatedly contemplate on these facts to allow the unattractiveness of the world to sink in.Non-attachment.  It means dispassion toward the world.  We have only one mind and if we wish to engage it in pursuing spiritual goals, we have to detach it from material objects and persons.  The sādhak replaces worldly attachment with love and attachment toward God. Absence of clinging to spouse, children, home, and so on.  These are areas where the mind easily becomes attached.  In bodily thinking, one spontaneously identifies with the family and home as “mine.”  Thus, they linger upon the mind more often and attachment to them shackles the mind to material consciousness.  Attachment causes expectations of the kind of behavior we want from family members, and when these expectations are not met, it leads to mental anguish.  Also inevitably, there is separation from the family, either temporarily, if they go to another place, or permanently, if they die.  All these experiences and their apprehensions begin to weigh heavily upon the mind and drag it away from God.  Hence, if we seek immortal bliss, we must practice prudence while interacting with the spouse, child, and home, to prevent the mind from becoming entangled.  We must do our duty toward them, without attachment, as a nurse does her duty in the hospital, or as a teacher does her duty toward her students in the school. Even-mindedness amidst desired and undesired events in life.  Pleasurable and painful events come without invitation, just as the night and the day.  That is life.  To rise above these dualities, we must learn to enhance our spiritual strength through detachment toward the world.  We must develop the ability to remain unperturbed by life’s reversals and also not get carried away with the euphoria of success. Constant and exclusive devotion toward Me.  Mere detachment means that the mind is not going in the negative direction.  But life is more than merely preventing the undesirable.  Life is about engaging in the desirable.  The desirable goal of life is to consecrate it at the lotus feet of God.  Therefore, Shree Krishna has highlighted it here.Inclination for solitary places.  Unlike worldly people, devotees are not driven by the need for company to overcome feelings of loneliness.  They naturally prefer solitude that enables them to engage their mind in communion with God.  Hence, they are naturally inclined to choosing solitary places, where they are able to more deeply absorb themselves in devotional thoughts. Aversion for mundane society.  The sign of a materialistic mind is that it finds pleasure in talks about worldly people and worldly affairs.  One who is cultivating divine consciousness develops a natural distaste

activities of eating, sleeping, mating, and defending.  However, God has especially blessed the human form with the faculty of knowledge.  This is not to enable us to engage in bodily activities in a

divine consciousness develops a natural distaste for these activities, and thus avoids mundane society.  At the same time, if it is necessary to participate in it for the sake of service to God, the devotee accepts it and develops the strength to remain mentally unaffected by it.Constancy in spiritual knowledge.  To theoretically know something is not enough.  One may know that anger is a bad thing but may still give vent to it repeatedly.  We have to learn to practically implement spiritual knowledge in our lives.  This does not happen by hearing profound truths just once.  After hearing them, we must repeatedly contemplate upon them.  Such mulling over the divine truths is the constancy in spiritual knowledge that Shree Krishna is talking about.Philosophical pursuit of the Absolute Truth.  Even animals engage in the bodily activities of eating, sleeping, mating, and defending.  However, God has especially blessed the human form with the faculty of knowledge.  This is not to enable us to engage in bodily activities in a deluxe way, but for us to contemplate upon the questions: “Who am I?  Why am I here?  What is my goal in life?  How was this world created?  What is my connection with the Creator?  How will I fulfill my purpose in life?”  This philosophic pursuit of the truth sublimates our thinking above the animalistic level and brings us to hear and read about the divine science of God-realization.All the virtues, habits, behaviors, and attitudes described above lead to the growth of wisdom and knowledge.  The opposite of these are vanity, hypocrisy, violence, vengeance, duplicity, disrespect for the Guru, uncleanliness of body and mind, unsteadiness, lack of self-control, longing for sense objects, conceit, entanglement in spouse, children, home, etc.  Such dispositions cripple the development self-knowledge.  Thus, Shree Krishna calls them ignorance and darkness.",to gain knowledge kṣhetra kṣhetrajña not merely intellectual exercise unlike

It is Knowledge, the Knowable, and the Known.

By understanding this My devotee becomes qualified for My state.,"Shree Krishna now concludes His description of the field and the object of knowledge, by mentioning the fruit of knowing this topic.  However, once again, He deems it fit to bring in devotion, and says that only the bhaktas (devotees) can truly understand this knowledge.  Those who practice karm, jñāna, aṣhṭāṅg, etc. devoid of bhakti cannot truly understand the import of the Bhagavad Gita, even though they themselves may think that they do.  Bhakti is the essential ingredient in all paths leading to knowledge of God. Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj puts this very nicely:jo hari sevā hetu ho, soī karm bakhānajo hari bhagati baṛhāve, soī samujhiya jñāna(Bhakti Śhatak 66) “That work which is done in devotion to God is the real karm; and that knowledge which increases love for God is real knowledge.” Devotion not only helps us to know God, it also makes the devotee godlike, and hence, Shree Krishna states that the devotees attain His nature.  This has been emphasized in the Vedic scriptures again and again.  The Vedas state:bhaktirevainaṁ nayati bhaktirevainaṁ paśhyati bhaktirevainaṁ darśhayati bhakti vaśhaḥ puruṣho bhaktireva bhūyasī  (Māṭhar Śhruti)“Bhakti alone can lead us to God.  Bhakti alone can make us see God.  Bhakti alone can bring us in the presence of God.  God is under the control of bhakti.  Hence, do bhakti exclusively.”  Again the Muṇḍakopaniṣhad states:upāsate puruṣhaṁ ye hyakāmā-ste śhukrametadativartanti dhīrāḥ   (3.2.1)“Those who engage in bhakti toward the Supreme Divine Personality, giving up all material desires, escape the cycle of life and death.”  Yet again, the Śhwetāśhvatar Upaniṣhad states:yasya deve parā bhaktiryathā deve tathā gurautasyaite kathitā hyarthā prakāśhante mahātmanaḥ   (6.23)“Those who have unflinching bhakti toward God and identical bhakti toward the Guru, in the hearts of such saintly persons, by the grace of God the imports of the Vedic scriptures are automatically revealed.”  The other Vedic Scriptures also reiterate this emphatically:na sādhayati māṁ yogo na sānkhyaṁ dharma uddhavana svādhyāyas tapas tyāgo yathā bhaktir mamorjitā(Bhagavatam 11.14.20)Shree Krishna states: “Uddhav, I am not attained by aṣhṭāṅg-yog, by the study of sānkhya, cultivation of scriptural knowledge, austerities, nor by renunciation.  It is by bhakti alone that I am won over.”  In the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna repeatedly states this, in verses 8.22, 11.54, etc.  In verse 18.55, He says:  “Only by loving devotion to Me does one come to know who I am in Truth. Then, having come to know Me, My devotee enters into full consciousness of Me.”  The Ramayan also says:rāmahi kevala premu piārā, jāni leu jo jānanihārā.“The Supreme Lord Ram is only attained through love.  Let this truth be known by all who care to know.”  Actually, this principle is emphasized in the other religious traditions as well.  In the Jewish Torah it is written: “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might (Deuteronomy 6.5).  Jesus of Nazareth repeats this commandment in the Christian New Testament as one of the first and foremost commandments to follow (Mark 12.30)   The Guru Granth Sahib states:hari sama jaga mahañ vastu nahiṅ, prem panth soñ panthasadguru sama sajjan nahīñ, gītā sama nahiñ grantha“There is no personality like God; there is no path equal to the path of devotion; there is no human equal to the Guru; and there is no scripture that can compare with the Gita.”",shree krishna concludes his description field object knowledge mentioning fruit knowing topic however he deems fit bring devotion says bhaktas devotees truly understand knowledge those practice karm jñāna aṣhṭāṅg etc devoid bhakti not truly understand import bhagavad gita even though may think bhakti essential ingredient paths leading knowledge god jagadguru shree kripaluji maharaj puts nicely jo hari sevā hetu ho soī karm bakhānajo hari bhagati baṛhāve soī samujhiya jñāna bhakti śhatak that work done devotion god real karm knowledge increases love god real knowledge devotion not helps us know god also makes devotee godlike hence shree krishna states devotees attain his nature this emphasized vedic scriptures the vedas state bhaktirevainaṁ nayati bhaktirevainaṁ paśhyati bhaktirevainaṁ darśhayati bhakti vaśhaḥ puruṣho bhaktireva bhūyasī māṭhar śhruti bhakti alone lead us god bhakti alone make us see god bhakti alone bring us presence god god control bhakti hence bhakti exclusively again muṇḍakopaniṣhad states upāsate puruṣhaṁ ye hyakāmāste śhukrametadativartanti dhīrāḥ those engage bhakti toward supreme divine personality giving material desires escape cycle life death yet śhwetāśhvatar upaniṣhad states yasya deve parā bhaktiryathā deve tathā gurautasyaite kathitā hyarthā prakāśhante mahātmanaḥ those unflinching bhakti toward god identical bhakti toward guru hearts saintly persons grace god imports vedic scriptures automatically revealed the vedic scriptures also reiterate emphatically na sādhayati māṁ yogo na sānkhyaṁ dharma uddhavana svādhyāyas tapas tyāgo yathā bhaktir mamorjitā bhagavatam shree krishna states uddhav i not attained aṣhṭāṅgyog study sānkhya cultivation scriptural knowledge austerities renunciation it bhakti alone i over in bhagavad gita shree krishna repeatedly states verses etc in verse he says only loving devotion me one come know i truth then come know me my devotee enters full consciousness me the ramayan also says rāmahi kevala premu piārā jāni leu jo jānanihārā the supreme lord ram attained love let truth known care know actually principle emphasized religious traditions well in jewish torah written you shall love lord god heart soul might deuteronomy jesus nazareth repeats commandment christian new testament one first foremost commandments follow mark the guru granth sahib states hari sama jaga mahañ vastu nahiṅ prem panth soñ panthasadguru sama sajjan nahīñ gītā sama nahiñ grantha there personality like god path equal path devotion human equal guru scripture compare gita

He added that this does not happen independently, but under the direction of the Supreme Lord, who is also seated within the body of the living being.

They will also not be obliged to stay in a state of suspended animation in the womb of God at the time of the universal dissolution, or be reborn along with the next creation. The three guṇas (modes of material nature) are indeed the cause of bondage, and knowledge of them will illumine the path out of bondage.Shree Krishna repeatedly uses the strategy of proclaiming the results of what he is about to teach, to bring his student to rapt attention. The words na vyathanti mean “they will not experience misery.” The word sādharmyam means they will acquire “a similar divine nature” as God himself. When the soul is released from the bondage of the material energy, it comes under the dominion of God’s divine Yogmaya energy. The divine energy equips it with God’s divine knowledge, love, and bliss.

Although it is divine, its identification with the body ties it to material nature. The material energy possess three guṇas—goodness, passion, and ignorance. Hence the body, mind, and intellect that are made from prakṛiti also possess these three modes.Consider the example of three-color printing. If any one of the colors is released in excess by the machine on the paper, then the picture acquires a hue of that color. Similarly, prakṛiti has the ink of the three colors. Based upon one’s internal thoughts, the external circumstances, past sanskārs, and other factors, one or the other of these modes becomes dominant for that person. And the mode that predominates creates its corresponding shade upon that person’s personality. Hence, the soul is swayed by the influence of these dominating modes. Shree Krishna now describes the impact of these modes upon the living being.",having explained lifeforms born puruṣh prakṛiti shree krishna explains next fourteen verses prakṛiti binds soul although divine identification body ties material nature the material energy possess three passion ignorance hence body mind intellect made prakṛiti also possess three modesconsider example threecolor printing if one colors released excess machine paper picture acquires hue color similarly prakṛiti ink three colors based upon one internal thoughts external circumstances past sanskārs factors one modes becomes dominant person and mode predominates creates corresponding shade upon person personality hence soul swayed influence dominating modes shree krishna describes impact modes upon living
14,6,तत्र सत्वं निर्मलत्वात्प्रकाशकमनामयम् | सुखसङ्गेन बध्नाति ज्ञानसङ्गेन चानघ ॥6॥,"Among them, sattva, being pure, [Nirmala, pure-transparent, i.e., capable of resisting any form of ignorance, and hence as illuminator, i.e. a revealer of Consciousness.] is an illuminator and is harmless. O sinless one, it binds through attachment to happiness and attachment to knowledge.","The word prakāśhakam means “illuminating.” The word anāmayam means “healthy and full of well-being.” By extension, it also means “of peaceful quality,” devoid of any inherent cause for pain, discomfort, or misery. The mode of goodness is serene and illuminating. Thus, sattva guṇa engenders virtue in one’s personality and illuminates the intellect with knowledge. It makes a person become calm, satisfied, charitable, compassionate, helpful, serene, and tranquil. It also nurtures good health and freedom from sickness. While the mode of goodness creates an effect of serenity and happiness, attachment to them itself binds the soul to material nature.Let us understand this through an example. A traveler was passing through a forest, when three robbers attacked him. The first said, “Let us kill him and steal all his wealth.” The second said, “No, let us not kill him. We will simply bind him, and take away his possessions.” Following the advice of the second robber, they tied him up in ropes and stole his wealth. When they had gone some distance away, the third robber returned. He opened the ropes of the traveler, and took him to the edge of the forest. He showed the way out, and said, “I cannot go out myself, but if you follow this path, you will be able to get out of the forest.”The first robber was tamo guṇa, the mode of ignorance, which literally wants to kill the soul, by degrading it into sloth, languor, and nescience. The second robber was rajo guṇa, the mode of passion, which excites the passions of the living being, and binds the soul in innumerable worldly desires. The third robber was sattva guṇa, the mode of goodness, which reduces the vices of the living being, eases the material discomfort and puts the soul on the path of virtue. Yet, even sattva guṇa is within the realm of material nature. We must not get attached to it; instead, we must use it to step up to the transcendental platform.Beyond these three, is śhuddha sattva, the transcendental mode of goodness. It is the mode of the divine energy of God that is beyond material nature. When the soul becomes God-realized, by his grace, God bestows śhuddha sattva upon the soul, making the senses, mind, and intellect divine.",the word prakāśhakam means illuminating the word anāmayam means healthy full wellbeing by extension also means peaceful quality devoid inherent cause pain discomfort misery the mode goodness serene illuminating thus sattva guṇa engenders virtue one personality illuminates intellect knowledge it makes person become calm satisfied charitable compassionate helpful serene tranquil it also nurtures good health freedom sickness while mode goodness creates effect serenity happiness attachment binds soul material naturelet us understand example a traveler passing forest three robbers attacked the first said let us kill steal wealth the second said no let us not kill we simply bind take away possessions following advice second robber tied ropes stole wealth when gone distance away third robber returned he opened ropes traveler took edge forest he showed way said i not go follow path able get forest the first robber tamo guṇa mode ignorance literally wants kill soul degrading sloth languor nescience the second robber rajo guṇa mode passion excites passions living binds soul innumerable worldly desires the third robber sattva guṇa mode goodness reduces vices living eases material discomfort puts soul path virtue yet even sattva guṇa within realm material nature we must not get attached instead must use step transcendental platformbeyond three śhuddha sattva transcendental mode goodness it mode divine energy god beyond material nature when soul becomes godrealized grace god bestows śhuddha sattva upon soul making senses mind intellect divine

O son of Kunti, that binds the embodied one through attachment to action.","Shree Krishna now explains the working of rajo guṇa, and how it binds the soul to material existence. The Patañjali Yog Darśhan describes material activity as the primary manifestation of rajo guṇa. Here, Shree Krishna describes its principal manifestation as attachment and desire.The mode of passion fuels the lust for sensual enjoyment. It inflames desires for mental and physical pleasures. It also promotes attachment to worldly things. Persons influenced by rajo guṇa get engrossed in worldly pursuits of status, prestige, career, family, and home. They look on these as sources of pleasure and are motivated to undertake intense activity for the sake of these. In this way, the mode of passion increases desires, and these desires further fuel an increase of the mode of passion. They both nourish each other and trap the soul in worldly life.The way to break out of this is to engage in karm yog, i.e. to begin offering the results of one’s activities to God. This creates detachment from the world, and pacifies the effect of rajo guṇa.",shree krishna explains working rajo guṇa binds soul material existence the patañjali yog darśhan describes material activity primary manifestation rajo guṇa here shree krishna describes principal manifestation attachment desirethe mode passion fuels lust sensual enjoyment it inflames desires mental physical pleasures it also promotes attachment worldly things persons influenced rajo guṇa get engrossed worldly pursuits status prestige career family home they look sources pleasure motivated undertake intense activity sake in way mode passion increases desires desires fuel increase mode passion they nourish trap soul worldly lifethe way break engage karm yog ie begin offering results one activities god this creates detachment world pacifies effect rajo guṇa

O scion of the Bharata dynasty, that binds through inadvertence, laziness and sleep.","Tamo guṇa is the antithesis of sattva guṇa. Persons influenced by it get pleasure through sleep, laziness, intoxication, violence, and gambling. They lose their discrimination of what is right and what is wrong, and do not hesitate in resorting to immoral behavior for fulfilling their self-will. Doing their duty becomes burdensome to them and they neglect it, becoming more inclined to sloth and sleep. In this way, the mode of ignorance leads the soul deeper into the darkness of ignorance. It becomes totally oblivious of its spiritual identity, its goal in life, and the opportunity for progress that the human form provides.",tamo guṇa antithesis sattva guṇa persons influenced get pleasure sleep laziness intoxication violence gambling they lose discrimination right wrong not hesitate resorting immoral behavior fulfilling selfwill doing duty becomes burdensome neglect becoming inclined sloth sleep in way mode ignorance leads soul deeper darkness ignorance it becomes totally oblivious spiritual identity goal life opportunity progress human form provides
14,9,सत्वं सुखे सञ्जयति रज: कर्मणि भारत | ज्ञानमावृत्य तु तम: प्रमादे सञ्जयत्युत ॥9॥,"O scion of the Bharata dynasty, sattva attaches one to happiness, rajas to action, while tamas, covering up knowledge, leads to inadvertence also.","In the mode of goodness, the miseries of material existence reduce, and worldly desires become subdued. This gives rise to a feeling of contentment with one’s condition. This is a good thing, but it can have a negative side too. For instance, those who experience pain in the world and are disturbed by the desires in their mind feel impelled to look for a solution to their problems, and this impetus sometimes brings them to the spiritual path. However, those in goodness can easily become complacent and feel no urge to progress to the transcendental platform. Also, sattva guṇa illumines the intellect with knowledge. If this is not accompanied by spiritual wisdom, then knowledge results in pride and that pride comes in the way of devotion to God. This is often seen in the case of scientists, academicians, scholars, etc. The mode of goodness usually predominates in them, since they spend their time and energy cultivating knowledge. And yet, the knowledge they possess often makes them proud, and they begin to feel that there can be no truth beyond the grasp of their intellect. Thus, they find it difficult to develop faith toward either the scriptures or the God-realized Saints.In the mode of passion, the souls are impelled toward intense activity. Their attachment to the world and preference for pleasure, prestige, wealth, and bodily comforts, propels them to work hard in the world for achieving these goals, which they consider to be the most important in life. Rajo guṇa increases the attraction between man and woman, and generates kām (lust). To satiate that lust, man and woman enter into the relationship of marriage and have a home. The upkeep of the home creates the need for wealth, so they begin to work hard for economic development. They engage in intense activity, but each action creates karmas, which further bind them in material existence.The mode of ignorance clouds the intellect of the living being. The desire for happiness now manifests in perverse manners. For example, everyone knows that cigarette smoking is injurious to health. Every cigarette pack carries a warning to that extent issued by the government authorities. Cigarette smokers read this, and yet do not refrain from smoking. This happens because the intellect loses its discriminative power and does not hesitate to inflict self-injury to get the pleasure of smoking. As someone jokingly said, “A cigarette is a pipe with a fire at one end and a fool at the other.” That is the influence of tamo guṇa, which binds the soul in the darkness of ignorance.",in mode goodness miseries material existence reduce worldly desires become subdued this gives rise feeling contentment one condition this good thing negative side for instance experience pain world disturbed desires mind feel impelled look solution problems impetus sometimes brings spiritual path however goodness easily become complacent feel urge progress transcendental platform also sattva guṇa illumines intellect knowledge if not accompanied spiritual wisdom knowledge results pride pride comes way devotion god this often seen case scientists academicians scholars etc the mode goodness usually predominates since spend time energy cultivating knowledge and yet knowledge possess often makes proud begin feel truth beyond grasp intellect thus find difficult develop faith toward either scriptures godrealized saintsin mode passion souls impelled toward intense activity their attachment world preference pleasure prestige wealth bodily comforts propels work hard world achieving goals consider important life rajo guṇa increases attraction man woman generates kām lust to satiate lust man woman enter relationship marriage home the upkeep home creates need wealth begin work hard economic development they engage intense activity action creates karmas bind material existencethe mode ignorance clouds intellect living the desire happiness manifests perverse manners for example everyone knows cigarette smoking injurious health every cigarette pack carries warning extent issued government authorities cigarette smokers read yet not refrain smoking this happens intellect loses discriminative power not hesitate inflict selfinjury get pleasure smoking as someone jokingly said a cigarette pipe fire one end fool other that influence tamo guṇa binds soul darkness ignorance
14,10,रजस्तमश्चाभिभूय सत्वं भवति भारत | रज: सत्वं तमश्चैव तम: सत्वं रजस्तथा ॥10॥,"O scion of the Bharata dynasty, sattva increases by subduing rajas and tamas, rajas by overpowering sattva and tamas, and tamas by dominating over sattva and rajas.","Shree Krishna now explains how the same individual’s temperament oscillates amongst the three guṇas. These three guṇas are present in the material energy, and our mind is made from the same energy. Hence, all the three guṇas are present in our mind as well. They can be compared to three wrestlers competing with each other. Each keeps throwing the others down, and so, sometimes the first is on top, sometimes the second, and sometimes the third. In the same manner, the three guṇas keep gaining dominance over the individual’s temperament, which oscillates amongst the three modes. Depending upon the external environment, the internal contemplation, and the sanskārs (tendencies) of past lives, one or the other guṇa begins to dominate. There is no rule for how long it stays—one guṇa may dominate the mind and intellect for as short as a moment or for as long as an hour.If sattva guṇa dominates, one becomes peaceful, content, generous, kind, helpful, serene, and tranquil. When rajo guṇa gains prominence, one becomes passionate, agitated, ambitious, envious of others success, and develops a gusto for sense pleasures. When tamo guna becomes prominent, one is overcome by sleep, laziness, hatred, anger, resentment, violence, and doubt.For example, let us suppose you are sitting in your library, engaged in study. There is no worldly disturbance, and your mind has become sāttvic. After finishing your study, you sit in your living room and switch on the television. Seeing all the images makes your mind rājasic, and increases your hankering for sense pleasures. While you are watching your favorite channel, your family member comes and changes the channel. This disturbance causes tamo guṇa to increase in your mind, and you are filled with anger. In this way, the mind sways amongst the three guṇas and adopts their qualities.",shree krishna explains individual temperament oscillates amongst three guṇas these three guṇas present material energy mind made energy hence three guṇas present mind well they compared three wrestlers competing each keeps throwing others sometimes first top sometimes second sometimes third in manner three guṇas keep gaining dominance individual temperament oscillates amongst three modes depending upon external environment internal contemplation sanskārs tendencies past lives one guṇa begins dominate there rule long guṇa may dominate mind intellect short moment long hourif sattva guṇa dominates one becomes peaceful content generous kind helpful serene tranquil when rajo guṇa gains prominence one becomes passionate agitated ambitious envious others success develops gusto sense pleasures when tamo guna becomes prominent one overcome sleep laziness hatred anger resentment violence doubtfor example let us suppose sitting library engaged study there worldly disturbance mind become sāttvic after finishing study sit living room switch television seeing images makes mind rājasic increases hankering sense pleasures while watching favorite channel family member comes changes channel this disturbance causes tamo guṇa increase mind filled anger in way mind sways amongst three guṇas adopts qualities
14,11,सर्वद्वारेषु देहेऽस्मिन्प्रकाश उपजायते | ज्ञानं यदा तदा विद्याद्विवृद्धं सत्वमित्युत ॥11॥,"When the illumination that is knowledge radiates in this body through all the doors (of the senses), then one should know that sattva has increased greatly.","Shree Krishna once again repeats how the three modes influence one’s thinking. Sattva guṇa leads to the development of virtues and the illumination of knowledge. Rajo guṇa leads to greed, inordinate activity for worldly attainments, and restlessness of the mind. Tamo guṇa results in delusion of the intellect, laziness, and inclination toward intoxication and violence.In fact, these modes even influence our attitudes toward God and the spiritual path. To give an example, when the mode of goodness becomes prominent in the mind, we may start thinking, “I have received so much grace from my Guru. I should endeavor to progress rapidly in my sādhanā, since the human form is precious and it should not be wasted in mundane pursuits.” When the mode of passion becomes prominent, we may think, “I must surely progress on the spiritual path, but what is the hurry? At present, I have many responsibilities to discharge, and they are more important.” When the mode of ignorance dominates, we could think, “I am not really sure if there is any God or not, for no one has ever seen him. So why waste time in sādhanā?” Notice how the same person’s thoughts have oscillated from such heights to the depths of devotion.For the mind to fluctuate due to the three guṇas is very natural. However, we are not to be dejected by this state of affairs, rather, we should understand why it happens and work to rise above it. Sādhanā means to fight with the flow of the three guṇas in the mind, and force it to maintain the devotional feelings toward God and Guru. If our consciousness remained at the highest consciousness all day, there would be no need for sādhanā. Though the mind’s natural sentiments may be inclined toward the world, yet with the intellect, we have to force it into the spiritual realm. Initially, this may seem difficult, but with practice it becomes easy.

14,13,अप्रकाशोऽप्रवृत्तिश्च प्रमादो मोह एव च | तमस्येतानि जायन्ते विवृद्धे कुरुनन्दन ॥13॥,"O descendant of the Kuru dynasty, when tamas predominates these surely come into being: non-discrimination and inactivity, inadvertence and delusion.","Shree Krishna once again repeats how the three modes influence one’s thinking. Sattva guṇa leads to the development of virtues and the illumination of knowledge. Rajo guṇa leads to greed, inordinate activity for worldly attainments, and restlessness of the mind. Tamo guṇa results in delusion of the intellect, laziness, and inclination toward intoxication and violence.In fact, these modes even influence our attitudes toward God and the spiritual path. To give an example, when the mode of goodness becomes prominent in the mind, we may start thinking, “I have received so much grace from my Guru. I should endeavor to progress rapidly in my sādhanā, since the human form is precious and it should not be wasted in mundane pursuits.” When the mode of passion becomes prominent, we may think, “I must surely progress on the spiritual path, but what is the hurry? At present, I have many responsibilities to discharge, and they are more important.” When the mode of ignorance dominates, we could think, “I am not really sure if there is any God or not, for no one has ever seen him. So why waste time in sādhanā?” Notice how the same person’s thoughts have oscillated from such heights to the depths of devotion.For the mind to fluctuate due to the three guṇas is very natural. However, we are not to be dejected by this state of affairs, rather, we should understand why it happens and work to rise above it. Sādhanā means to fight with the flow of the three guṇas in the mind, and force it to maintain the devotional feelings toward God and Guru. If our consciousness remained at the highest consciousness all day, there would be no need for sādhanā. Though the mind’s natural sentiments may be inclined toward the world, yet with the intellect, we have to force it into the spiritual realm. Initially, this may seem difficult, but with practice it becomes easy. This is just as driving a car is difficult initially, but with practice it becomes natural.Shree Krishna now begins to explain the destinations bestowed by the three guṇas, and the need for making it our goal to transcend them.",shree krishna repeats three modes influence one thinking sattva guṇa leads development virtues illumination knowledge rajo guṇa leads greed inordinate activity worldly attainments restlessness mind tamo guṇa results delusion intellect laziness inclination toward intoxication violencein fact modes even influence attitudes toward god spiritual path to give example mode goodness becomes prominent mind may start thinking i received much grace guru i endeavor progress rapidly sādhanā since human form precious not wasted mundane pursuits when mode passion becomes prominent may think i must surely progress spiritual path hurry at present i many responsibilities discharge important when mode ignorance dominates could think i not really sure god not one ever seen so waste time sādhanā notice person thoughts oscillated heights depths devotionfor mind fluctuate due three guṇas natural however not dejected state affairs rather understand happens work rise sādhanā means fight flow three guṇas mind force maintain devotional feelings toward god guru if consciousness remained highest consciousness day would need sādhanā though mind natural sentiments may inclined toward world yet intellect force spiritual realm initially may seem difficult practice becomes easy this driving car difficult initially practice becomes naturalshree krishna begins explain destinations bestowed three guṇas need making goal transcend

But the result of rajas is sorrow; the result of tamas is ignorance.,"Those influenced by sattva are equipped with a measure of purity, virtue, knowledge, and selflessness. Hence, their actions are performed with a relatively pure intention and the results are uplifting and satisfying. Those influenced by rajas are agitated by the desires of their senses and mind. The intention behind their works is primarily self-aggrandizement and sense-gratification for themselves and their dependents. Thus, their works lead to the enjoyment of sense pleasures, which further fuels their sensual desires. Those who are predominated by tamas have no respect for scriptural injunctions and codes of conduct. They commit sinful deeds to relish perverse pleasures, which only result in further immersing them in delusion.",those influenced sattva equipped measure purity virtue knowledge selflessness hence actions performed relatively pure intention results uplifting satisfying those influenced rajas agitated desires senses mind the intention behind works primarily selfaggrandizement sensegratification dependents thus works lead enjoyment sense pleasures fuels sensual desires those predominated tamas respect scriptural injunctions codes conduct they commit sinful deeds relish perverse pleasures result immersing delusion

From tamas are born inadvertence and delusion as also ignorance, to be sure.","Having mentioned the variation in the results that accrue from the three guṇas, Shree Krishna now gives the reason for this. Sattva guṇa gives rise to wisdom, which confers the ability to discriminate between right and wrong. It also pacifies the desires of the senses for gratification, and creates a concurrent feeling of happiness and contentment. People influenced by it are inclined toward intellectual pursuits and virtuous ideas. Thus, the mode of goodness promotes wise actions. Rajo guṇa inflames the senses, and puts the mind out of control, sending it into a spin of ambitious desires. The living being is trapped by it and over-endeavors for wealth and pleasures that are meaningless from the perspective of the soul. Tamo guṇa covers the living being with inertia and nescience. Shrouded in ignorance, a person performs wicked and impious deeds and bears consequent results.",having mentioned variation results accrue three guṇas shree krishna gives reason sattva guṇa gives rise wisdom confers ability discriminate right wrong it also pacifies desires senses gratification creates concurrent feeling happiness contentment people influenced inclined toward intellectual pursuits virtuous ideas thus mode goodness promotes wise actions rajo guṇa inflames senses puts mind control sending spin ambitious desires the living trapped overendeavors wealth pleasures meaningless perspective soul tamo guṇa covers living inertia nescience shrouded ignorance person performs wicked impious deeds bears consequent results

Upon completion of their sojourn in the present life, the souls reach the kind of place that corresponds to their guṇas. This can be compared to students applying for college admission after completing school. There are many colleges in the country. Those students with good qualifying criteria at the school level gain admission in the best colleges, while those with poor grades and other scores are admitted to the worst ones. Likewise, the Bhāgavatam says:sattve pralīnāḥ svar yānti nara-lokaṁ rajo-layāḥtamo-layās tu nirayaṁ yānti mām eva nirguṇāḥ (11.25.22)[v2]“Those who are in sattva guṇa reach the higher celestial abodes; those who are in rajo guṇa return to the earth planet; and those who are in tamo guṇa go to the nether worlds; while those who are transcendental to the three modes attain Me.”",shree krishna explains reincarnation souls next birth linked guṇas predominates personality upon completion sojourn present life souls reach kind place corresponds guṇas this compared students applying college admission completing school there many colleges country those students good qualifying criteria school level gain admission best colleges poor grades scores admitted worst ones likewise bhāgavatam says sattve pralīnāḥ svar yānti naralokaṁ rajolayāḥtamolayās tu nirayaṁ yānti mām eva nirguṇāḥ those sattva guṇa reach higher celestial abodes rajo guṇa return earth planet tamo guṇa go nether worlds transcendental three modes attain me
14,19,नान्यं गुणेभ्य: कर्तारं यदा द्रष्टानुपश्यति | गुणेभ्यश्च परं वेत्ति मद्भावं सोऽधिगच्छति ॥19॥,"When the witness sees none other than the qualities as the agent, and knows that which is superior [i.e. different from.] to the qualities, he attains My nature.","Having revealed the complex workings of the three guṇas, Shree Krishna now shows the simple solution for breaking out of their bondage. All the living entities in the world are under the grip of the three guṇas, and hence the guṇas are the active agents in all the works being done in the world. But the Supreme Lord is beyond them. Therefore, he is called tri-guṇātīt (transcendental to the modes of material nature). Similarly, all the attributes of God—his names, forms, virtues, pastimes, abodes, saints—are also tri-guṇātīt.If we attach our mind to any personality or object within the realm of the three guṇas, it results in increasing their corresponding color on our mind and intellect. However, if we attach our mind to the divine realm, it transcends the guṇas and becomes divine. Those who understand this principle start loosening their relationship with worldly objects and people, and strengthening it, through bhakti, with God and the Guru. This enables them to transcend the three guṇas, and attain the divine nature of God. This is further elaborated in verse 14.26.",having revealed complex workings three guṇas shree krishna shows simple solution breaking bondage all living entities world grip three guṇas hence guṇas active agents works done world but supreme lord beyond therefore called triguṇātīt transcendental modes material nature similarly attributes names forms virtues pastimes abodes also triguṇātītif attach mind personality object within realm three guṇas results increasing corresponding color mind intellect however attach mind divine realm transcends guṇas becomes divine those understand principle start loosening relationship worldly objects people strengthening bhakti god guru this enables transcend three guṇas attain divine nature god this elaborated verse
14,20,गुणानेतानतीत्य त्रीन्देही देहसमुद्भवान् | जन्ममृत्युजरादु:खैर्विमुक्तोऽमृतमश्रुते ॥20॥,"Having transcended these three qualities which are the origin of the body, the embodied one, becoming free from birth, death, old age and sorrows, experiences Immortality.","If we drink water from a dirty well, we are bound to get a stomach upset. Similarly, if we are influenced by the three modes, we are bound to experience their consequences, which are repeated birth within the material realm, disease, old age, and death. These four are the primary miseries of material life. It was by seeing these that the Buddha first realized that the world is a place of misery, and then searched for the way out of misery.The Vedas prescribe a number of codes of conduct, social duties, rituals, and regulations for human beings. These prescribed duties and codes of conduct are together called karm dharma, or varṇāśhram dharma, or śhārīrik dharma. They help elevate us from tamo guṇa and rajo guṇa to sattva guṇa. However, to reach sattva guṇa is not enough; it is also a form of bondage. The mode of goodness can be equated to being fettered with chains of gold. Our goal lies even beyond it—to get out of the prison house of material existence.Shree Krishna explains that when we transcend the three modes, then Maya no longer binds the living being. Thus, the soul gets released from the cycle of life and death and attains immortality. Factually, the soul is always immortal. However, its identification with the material body makes it suffer the illusion of birth and death. This illusory experience is against the eternal nature of the soul, which seeks release from it. Hence, the material illusion is naturally discomforting to our inner being and, from within, we all seek the taste of immortality.",if drink water dirty well bound get stomach upset similarly influenced three modes bound experience consequences repeated birth within material realm disease old age death these four primary miseries material life it seeing buddha first realized world place misery searched way miserythe vedas prescribe number codes conduct social duties rituals regulations human beings these prescribed duties codes conduct together called karm dharma varṇāśhram dharma śhārīrik dharma they help elevate us tamo guṇa rajo guṇa sattva guṇa however reach sattva guṇa not enough also form bondage the mode goodness equated fettered chains gold our goal lies even beyond get prison house material existenceshree krishna explains transcend three modes maya longer binds living thus soul gets released cycle life death attains immortality factually soul always immortal however identification material body makes suffer illusion birth death this illusory experience eternal nature soul seeks release hence material illusion naturally discomforting inner within seek taste immortality

They are not disturbed when they see the guṇas functioning in the world, and their effects manifesting in persons, objects, and situations around them. Illumined persons do not hate ignorance when they see it, nor get implicated in it. Worldly-minded become overly concerned with the condition of the world. They spend their time and energy brooding about the state of things in the world. The enlightened souls also strive for human welfare, but they do so because it is their nature to help others. At the same time, they realize that the world is ultimately in the hands of God. They simply have to do their duty to the best of their ability, and leave the rest in the hands of God. Having come into God’s world, our first duty is how to purify ourselves. Then, with a pure mind, we will naturally do good and beneficial works in the world, without allowing worldly situations to bear too heavily upon us. As Mahatma Gandhi said: “Be the change that you wish to see in the world.”Shree Krishna explains that persons of illumination, who know themselves to be transcendental to the functioning of the modes, are neither miserable nor jubilant when the modes of nature perform their natural functions in the world. In fact, even when they perceive these guṇas in their mind, they do not feel disturbed. The mind is made from the material energy, and thus contains the three modes of Maya. So it is natural for the mind to be subjected to the influence of the guṇas, and their corresponding thoughts. The problem is that in bodily consciousness we do not see the mind as different from ourselves. And so, when the mind presents a disturbing thought, we feel, “Oh! I am thinking in this negative manner.” We begin to associate with the poisonous thoughts, allowing them to reside in us and damage us spiritually. To the extent that even if the mind presents a thought against God and Guru, we accept the thought as ours. If, at that time, we could see the mind as separate from us, we would be able to dissociate ourselves from negative thoughts. We would then reject the thoughts of the mind, “I will have nothing to do with any thought that is not conducive to my devotion.” Persons on the transcendental platform have mastered the art of distancing themselves from all negative thoughts arising in the mind from the flow of the guṇas.",shree krishna clarifies traits transcended three guṇas they not disturbed see guṇas functioning world effects manifesting persons objects situations around illumined persons not hate ignorance see get implicated worldlyminded become overly concerned condition world they spend time energy brooding state things world the enlightened souls also strive human welfare nature help others at time realize world ultimately hands god they simply duty best ability leave rest hands god having come god world first duty purify then pure mind naturally good beneficial works world without allowing worldly situations bear heavily upon us as mahatma gandhi said be change wish see world shree krishna explains persons illumination know transcendental functioning modes neither miserable jubilant modes nature perform natural functions world in fact even perceive guṇas mind not feel disturbed the mind made material energy thus contains three modes maya so natural mind subjected influence guṇas corresponding thoughts the problem bodily consciousness not see mind different and mind presents disturbing thought feel oh i thinking negative manner we begin associate poisonous thoughts allowing reside us damage us spiritually to extent even mind presents thought god guru accept thought if time could see mind separate us would able dissociate negative thoughts we would reject thoughts mind i nothing thought not conducive devotion persons transcendental platform mastered art distancing negative thoughts arising mind flow guṇas

The above verse indicates that mere knowledge of the self and its distinction with the body is not enough. With the help of bhakti yog, the mind has to be fixed on the Supreme Lord, Shree Krishna. Then alone will the mind become nirguṇa (untouched by the three modes), just as Shree Krishna is nirguṇa.Many people are of the view that if the mind is fixed upon the personal form of God, it will not rise to the transcendental platform. Only when it is attached to the formless Brahman, will the mind become transcendental to the modes of material nature. However, this verse refutes such a view. Although the personal form of God possesses infinite guṇas (qualities), these are all divine and beyond the modes of material nature. Hence, the personal form of God is also nirguṇa (beyond the three material modes). Sage Ved Vyas explains how the personal form of God is nirguṇa:yastu nirguṇa ityuktaḥ śhāstreṣhu jagadīśhvaraḥprākṛitairheya sanyuktairguṇairhīnatvamuchyate (Padma Purāṇ)[v3]“Wherever the scriptures refer to God as nirguṇa (without attributes), they mean that he is without material attributes. Nevertheless, his divine personality is not devoid of qualities—he possesses infinite divine attributes.”This verse also reveals the proper object of meditation. Transcendental meditation does not mean to meditate upon nothingness. The entity transcendental to the three modes of material nature is God. And so, only when the object of our meditation is God can it truly be called transcendental meditation.",having explained traits situated beyond three guṇas shree krishna reveals one method transcending modes material nature the verse indicates mere knowledge self distinction body not enough with help bhakti yog mind fixed supreme lord shree krishna then alone mind become nirguṇa untouched three modes shree krishna nirguṇamany people view mind fixed upon personal form god not rise transcendental platform only attached formless brahman mind become transcendental modes material nature however verse refutes view although personal form god possesses infinite guṇas qualities divine beyond modes material nature hence personal form god also nirguṇa beyond three material modes sage ved vyas explains personal form god nirguṇa yastu nirguṇa ityuktaḥ śhāstreṣhu jagadīśhvaraḥprākṛitairheya sanyuktairguṇairhīnatvamuchyate padma purāṇ wherever scriptures refer god nirguṇa without attributes mean without material attributes nevertheless divine personality not devoid possesses infinite divine attributes this verse also reveals proper object meditation transcendental meditation not mean meditate upon nothingness the entity transcendental three modes material nature god and object meditation god truly called transcendental meditation

It was previously stated that the all-powerful God has both aspects to his personality—the formless and the personal form.

Padma Purāṇ states:yannakhenduruchirbrahma dhyeyaṁ brahmādibhiḥ suraiḥguṇatrayamatītaṁ taṁ vande vṛindāvaneśhvaram(Patal Khand 77.60)[v4]“The light that emanates from the toe nails of the feet of the Lord of Vrindavan, Shree Krishna, is the transcendental Brahman that the jñānīs and even the celestial gods meditate upon.” Similarly, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu said:tāñhāra aṅgera śhuddha kiraṇa-maṇḍalaupaniṣhat kahe tāñre brahma sunirmala(Chaitanya Charitāmṛit, Ādi Leela 2.12) [v5]“The effulgence emanating from the divine body of God is described by the Upaniṣhads as Brahman.” Thus, in this verse, Shree Krishna unequivocally confirms that the panacea for the disease of the three guṇas is to engage in unwavering devotion to the personal form of the Supreme Lord.",the previous verse may give rise question relationship shree krishna formless brahman it previously stated allpowerful god aspects formless personal form here shree krishna reveals brahman jñānīs worship light personal form god padma purāṇ states yannakhenduruchirbrahma dhyeyaṁ brahmādibhiḥ suraiḥguṇatrayamatītaṁ taṁ vande vṛindāvaneśhvaram patal khand the light emanates toe nails feet lord vrindavan shree krishna transcendental brahman jñānīs even celestial gods meditate upon similarly chaitanya mahaprabhu said tāñhāra aṅgera śhuddha kiraṇamaṇḍalaupaniṣhat kahe tāñre brahma sunirmala chaitanya charitāmṛit ādi leela the effulgence emanating divine body god described upaniṣhads brahman thus verse shree krishna unequivocally confirms panacea disease three guṇas engage unwavering devotion personal form supreme lord
15,1,श्रीभगवानुवाच | ऊर्ध्वमूलमध:शाखमश्वत्थं प्राहुरव्ययम् | छन्दांसि यस्य पर्णानि यस्तं वेद स वेदवित् ॥1॥,"The Blessed Lord said: They say that the peepul Tree, which has its roots upward and the branches downward, and of which the Vedas are the leaves, is imperishable. He who realizes it is knower of the Vedas.","Lord Shree Krishna speaks of the eternal Aśhvatth tree, which is an upside-down peepal (sacred fig) tree with its roots above and branches below. Aśhvatth also means; which will not remain the same even on the next day or something which is constantly changing. The Sanskrit word for the world, Sansar is defined in the Sanskrit dictionary as sansaratīti sansāraḥ; something that is constantly shifting.  Another Sanskrit word for the world Jagat is also defined as gachchhatīti jagat, that means it is a constantly moving world. The world is not just moving or constantly changing, but someday it will be completely destroyed and reverted unto God. Therefore, the world we live in is temporary, or Aśhvatth.The Lord explains that this material world is like a huge Aśhvatth tree for the soul. Its roots are going upwards (ūrdhva-mūlam) originating from God; nourished and supported by Him. The trunk and branches which are extending downwards (adhaḥ-śhākham) encompass all the life-forms from different abodes of the material realm. Its leaves are the Vedic mantras (chhandānsi), which describe rituals, ceremonies, and its reward. By performing such rituals, the soul can ascend to the heavenly abodes and enjoy celestial pleasures, but eventually, when the rewards deplete, they have to fall back to earth.In this way, the leaves of the Aśhvatth tree nourish the material existence of the souls and perpetuate the continuous cycle of life and death. Due to this continuity, the beginning and the end are not experienced by the souls. Hence, this tree form of the world is Avyayam or eternal. As the water from the oceans evaporates forming clouds that rain the earth, which then forms rivers, and eventually flows back to the oceans. Likewise, the cycle of life and death is also continuous.The Vedas also mention this tree:ūrdhvamūlo ’vākśhākha eṣho ’śhvatthaḥ sanātanaḥ   (Kaṭhopaniṣhad 2.3.1) “The aśhvatth tree, with its roots upward and branches downward is eternal.”ūrdhvamūlaṁ arvākśhākhaṁ vṛikṣhaṁ yo sampratina sa jātu janaḥ śhraddhayātmṛityutyurmā mārayaditi   (Taittirīya Āraṇyak 1.11.5)“Those who know this tree with its roots upward and branches downward will not believe that death can finish them.” The intention of describing this tree in the Vedas was to make us understand that, we are beyond the cycle of life and death, and we should work towards cutting this tree down. For the same purpose, Lord Shree Krishna has mentioned that one who understands the secret (of cutting) this tree of samsara is the knower of the Vedas (veda vit).",lord shree krishna speaks eternal aśhvatth tree upsidedown peepal sacred fig tree roots branches aśhvatth also means not remain even next day something constantly changing the sanskrit word world sansar defined sanskrit dictionary sansaratīti sansāraḥ something constantly shifting another sanskrit word world jagat also defined gachchhatīti jagat means constantly moving world the world not moving constantly changing someday completely destroyed reverted unto god therefore world live temporary aśhvatththe lord explains material world like huge aśhvatth tree soul its roots going upwards ūrdhvamūlam originating god nourished supported him the trunk branches extending downwards adhaḥśhākham encompass lifeforms different abodes material realm its leaves vedic mantras chhandānsi describe rituals ceremonies reward by performing rituals soul ascend heavenly abodes enjoy celestial pleasures eventually rewards deplete fall back earthin way leaves aśhvatth tree nourish material existence souls perpetuate continuous cycle life death due continuity beginning end not experienced souls hence tree form world avyayam eternal as water oceans evaporates forming clouds rain earth forms rivers eventually flows back oceans likewise cycle life death also continuousthe vedas also mention tree ūrdhvamūlo vākśhākha eṣho śhvatthaḥ sanātanaḥ kaṭhopaniṣhad the aśhvatth tree roots upward branches downward eternal ūrdhvamūlaṁ arvākśhākhaṁ vṛikṣhaṁ yo sampratina sa jātu janaḥ śhraddhayātmṛityutyurmā mārayaditi taittirīya āraṇyak those know tree roots upward branches downward not believe death finish them the intention describing tree vedas make us understand beyond cycle life death work towards cutting tree for purpose lord shree krishna mentioned one understands secret cutting tree samsara knower vedas veda vit
15,2,अधश्चोर्ध्वं प्रसृतास्तस्य शाखा गुणप्रवृद्धा विषयप्रवाला: | अधश्च मूलान्यनुसन्ततानि कर्मानुबन्धीनि मनुष्यलोके ॥2॥,"The branches of that (Tree), extending down-wards and upwards, are strengthened by the qualities and have sense-objects as their shoots. And the roots, which are followed by actions, spread down-wards in the human world.","Lord Krishna went on to explain how the human form is similar to the aśhvatth tree. While in the human form the soul performs karmas, which is the trunk of the tree, and its branches (śhākhās) extend both upward (ūrddhva) and downward (adhaḥ). Based on how the soul performed in its past and present forms it is reborn. If it led a virtuous life, when reborn, it moves to the upward branches which denote the celestial abodes of the gandharvas, devatās, etc. In case, a soul was involved in sinful acts, in the next birth, it gets degraded to the downwards branches, which are for the nether regions and animal species.Similar to how water irrigates a tree, the three modes of material nature or the three gunas irrigate this eternal tree of material existence. The sense objects generated by these gunas are like buds on the tree (viṣhaya-pravālāḥ), which sprout causing further growth.  These buds sprout creating several aerial roots of material desires. For example, another tree of the fig family, the banyan tree has aerial roots which grow straight from the branches, down to the ground, and with the passage of time these turn into secondary trunks. This makes the banyan tree grow huge, covering a large area. “The Great Banyan” in the Botanical Garden of Kolkata, is one of the largest known banyan trees. It is spread across a vast area of about 4.7 acres, with over 3700 aerial roots and crown circumference of about 486 meters. Likewise, in the context of the material world, the sense objects are like the buds on the aśhvatth tree, which sprout into aerial roots as they evoke desires of bodily pleasures in a person. To satiate these desires, a living being performs karma. But these desires are unending and keep increasing; similar to the aerial roots, which provide nourishment to this metaphorical tree, causing its unlimited expansion. Eventually, the soul gets further entangled into this web of material consciousness.",lord krishna went explain human form similar aśhvatth tree while human form soul performs karmas trunk tree branches śhākhās extend upward ūrddhva downward adhaḥ based soul performed past present forms reborn if led virtuous life reborn moves upward branches denote celestial abodes gandharvas devatās etc in case soul involved sinful acts next birth gets degraded downwards branches nether regions animal speciessimilar water irrigates tree three modes material nature three gunas irrigate eternal tree material existence the sense objects generated gunas like buds tree viṣhayapravālāḥ sprout causing growth these buds sprout creating several aerial roots material desires for example another tree fig family banyan tree aerial roots grow straight branches ground passage time turn secondary trunks this makes banyan tree grow huge covering large area the great banyan botanical garden kolkata one largest known banyan trees it spread across vast area acres aerial roots crown circumference meters likewise context material world sense objects like buds aśhvatth tree sprout aerial roots evoke desires bodily pleasures person to satiate desires living performs karma but desires unending keep increasing similar aerial roots provide nourishment metaphorical tree causing unlimited expansion eventually soul gets entangled web material consciousness

The buds of the tree, which are the objects of the senses lure them into developing desires. Ignorant souls keep working hard towards fulfilling these desires, which only keep increasing and nourish the tree to grow further. When such desires are fulfilled, they return with double the intensity forming greed. But when obstructed it causes anger, which fogs the intellect and further deepens the ignorance.   In the bodily form, the soul only thinks of itself to be the person in flesh and bones. It is forgetful of its origin and its eternal existence. It identifies itself with its human name, family, country, etc. Thus, to satisfy the bodily needs and in quest of material happiness, the living being gets involved in unfruitful endeavors. Sometimes to satiate one’s materialistic desires knowingly or unknowingly a human being commits sins. These cause it to move downward and it is reborn in the lower species and nether regions. Whereas, sometimes it gets attracted towards the leaves of this tree, which are the ritualistic ceremonies of the Vedas, these help in accumulating pious merits. The propensity of material pleasures drives the human being to involve in such pious activities. The pious merits help the soul move upward in the celestial abodes, but once these merits deplete, it is sent back to the lower forms, and this cycle continues. Thus, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu said:kṛiṣhṇa bhuli ’sei jīva anādi-bahirmukha, ataeva māyā tāre deya samsāra-duḥkhakabhu swarge uṭhāya, kabhu narake ḍubāya, daṇḍya-jane rājā yena nadīte chubāy(Chaitanya Charitāmṛit, Madhya Leela 20.117-118)“Since the soul is forgetful of God since eternity, the material energy is subjecting it to worldly miseries.  Sometimes, it lifts the soul to the celestial abodes, and other times it drops it down to the hellish regions.  This is akin to the torture meted by kings in olden times.”  In the olden days, some kings ordered a very torturous punishment, wherein a person’s head was immersed into the water almost till suffocation, then released for a few gasps, again put back into the water, and was repeated. The condition is similar for a soul trapped in the tree of material existence, it is pushed back and forth between the upper and lower regions according to its merits. When born in the celestial forms it enjoys some temporary relief, which fades soon and the soul gets dropped back to the human form.  Several lifetimes have passed, and the soul continues to work towards material enjoyment. This has caused the tree to expand its roots of desire farther and has become huge. Yet, this tree can be cut with dispassion says, Lord Shree Krishna. The remedy for the soul’s never-ending suffering is asaṅg, which means detachment. The axe of detachment can cut the roots of desires which are nourished by the three modes of material nature. The Lord further explains that this axe of detachment can only be developed with the knowledge of the self. One has to realize that, “I am not this material body, but an eternal spiritual being. The everlasting happiness that I pursue cannot be achieved with material things. My endeavors towards gratification of the material desires of this material body have no satiation, they are only getting me further trapped in the samsara or the web of life and death.”  With detachment, one can stop further growth of the tree roots, and due to lack of nourishment, the tree starts to wither.The next step is to look for the base of this upside-down tree, which in real terms is on the top and much higher than everything else. It’s here that the Supreme Lord of all creation resides. As Lord Shree Krishna had earlier mentioned, “I am the origin of all creation. Everything proceeds from Me. The wise who know this perfectly worship Me with great faith and devotion.”  (Verse 10.8) Therefore, to find the ultimate source, we must surrender to God as explained in this verse: “I submit unto Him from whom the universe came into being a long time ago.”This way, the unfathomable tree can be conquered and axed. However, in an earlier verse Shree Krishna has also said that, “My divine energy, Maya, consisting of the three modes of nature, is very difficult to overcome.  But those who surrender unto Me cross over it easily.” (Verse 7.14) Therefore, the only way to cut down the aśhvatth tree is by totally surrendering to the Supreme Lord and taking his refuge. By doing this, we will not return to this material world, and after death will go to His divine Abode.In the next verse, Shree Krishna has revealed the requirements for the process of surrender.",shree krishna says mystery aśhvatth tree not easy understand embodied souls deeply entangled continuous cycle life death the buds tree objects senses lure developing desires ignorant souls keep working hard towards fulfilling desires keep increasing nourish tree grow when desires fulfilled return double intensity forming greed but obstructed causes anger fogs intellect deepens ignorance in bodily form soul thinks person flesh bones it forgetful origin eternal existence it identifies human name family country etc thus satisfy bodily needs quest material happiness living gets involved unfruitful endeavors sometimes satiate one materialistic desires knowingly unknowingly human commits sins these cause move downward reborn lower species nether regions whereas sometimes gets attracted towards leaves tree ritualistic ceremonies vedas help accumulating pious merits the propensity material pleasures drives human involve pious activities the pious merits help soul move upward celestial abodes merits deplete sent back lower forms cycle continues thus chaitanya mahaprabhu said kṛiṣhṇa bhuli sei jīva anādibahirmukha ataeva māyā tāre deya samsāraduḥkhakabhu swarge uṭhāya kabhu narake ḍubāya daṇḍyajane rājā yena nadīte chubāy chaitanya charitāmṛit madhya leela since soul forgetful god since eternity material energy subjecting worldly miseries sometimes lifts soul celestial abodes times drops hellish regions this akin torture meted kings olden times in olden days kings ordered torturous punishment wherein person head immersed water almost till suffocation released gasps put back water repeated the condition similar soul trapped tree material existence pushed back forth upper lower regions according merits when born celestial forms enjoys temporary relief fades soon soul gets dropped back human form several lifetimes passed soul continues work towards material enjoyment this caused tree expand roots desire farther become huge yet tree cut dispassion says lord shree krishna the remedy soul neverending suffering asaṅg means detachment the axe detachment cut roots desires nourished three modes material nature the lord explains axe detachment developed knowledge self one realize i not material body eternal spiritual the everlasting happiness i pursue not achieved material things my endeavors towards gratification material desires material body satiation getting trapped samsara web life death with detachment one stop growth tree roots due lack nourishment tree starts witherthe next step look base upsidedown tree real terms top much higher everything else it supreme lord creation resides as lord shree krishna earlier mentioned i origin creation everything proceeds me the wise know perfectly worship me great faith devotion verse therefore find ultimate source must surrender god explained verse i submit unto him universe came long time ago this way unfathomable tree conquered axed however earlier verse shree krishna also said my divine energy maya consisting three modes nature difficult overcome but surrender unto me cross easily verse therefore way cut aśhvatth tree totally surrendering supreme lord taking refuge by not return material world death go his divine abodein next verse shree krishna revealed requirements process surrender

15,5,निर्मानमोहा जितसङ्गदोषा अध्यात्मनित्या विनिवृत्तकामा: | द्वन्द्वैर्विमुक्ता: सुखदु:खसंज्ञै र्गच्छन्त्यमूढा: पदमव्ययं तत् ॥5॥,"The wise ones who are free from pride and non-discrimination, who have conquered the evil of association, [Hatred and love arising from association with foes and friends.] who are ever devoted to spirituality, completely free from desires, free from the dualities called happiness and sorrow, reach that undecaying State.","In this verse, Shree Krishna has explained the requisites for complete surrender to the Supreme Lord, who is at the base of this enigmatic aśhvatth tree.  The first step is to give up all pride, which is due to ignorance. The embodied souls have an illusion that they are the governors of all the material wealth that they have acquired, and continue accumulating more. Their minds are blinded by pride borne by ignorance, they think that all this is for their enjoyment, and would continue giving them happiness. A soul in such a state does not comprehend God as the owner of all. Thus, cannot surrender unto his will.Only through proper knowledge of God can this false notion of being the enjoyer be removed. It is necessary to realize that God alone is the owner of all the material energy and it needs to be used for his service only. He is the master of the entire creation, and the souls are his eternal servants. The souls should give up the attitude of pride and develop an attitude of selfless service to the Lord. This can be achieved by understanding the true nature of the self as the eternal servant, eliminating material attachments that pull us towards the world and away from him. The Padma Purāṇ states:dāsa bhūtamidaṁ tasya jagatsthāvara jangamamśhrīmannārāyaṇa swāmī jagatānprabhurīśhwaraḥ“The Supreme Lord Narayan is the controller and the Lord of the world.  All moving and non-moving beings and entities in this creation are His servants.”  Hence, as our desire to serve God increases, the illusion of being the enjoyer of prakṛiti (material world) gets gradually eliminated and the heart is cleansed.  Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj emphasizes this above everything else, as the most powerful means for purifying the heart:sau bātana kī bāta ika, dharu muralīdhara dhyāna,baṛhavahu sevā-vāsanā, yaha sau jñānana jñāna.(Bhakti Śhatak, verse 74) “Out of a hundred advice for purification, the most important is this.  Let your mind be absorbed in the divine flute-player, Shree Krishna, and keep increasing your desire to serve Him.  This counsel is more important than a hundred such gems of knowledge.” But what happens once our etheric hearts are cleansed and become perfectly situated in the loving service of the Lord? In this verse, Shree Krishna says that all those perfected souls enter his spiritual realm and stay there forever. Once the state of God-realization is achieved, the material realm serves no purpose, the soul is free from the cycle of life and death. It now stays in God’s divine Abode along with other perfected, God-realized souls. The material realm is only one-fourth, while the spiritual realm is three-fourths of the entire creation. As a city prison only occupies a small part of a large city, similarly, the material realm is a very small part of God’s vast creation. The Vedas state:pādo ’sya viśhwā bhūtāni, tripādasya amṛitam divi   (Puruṣh Sūktam Mantra 3)“This temporary world made from the material energy is but one part of creation.  The other three parts are the eternal Abode of God that is beyond the phenomenon of life and death.”In the next verse, Shree Krishna explains the nature of the eternal Abode.",in verse shree krishna explained requisites complete surrender supreme lord base enigmatic aśhvatth tree the first step give pride due ignorance the embodied souls illusion governors material wealth acquired continue accumulating their minds blinded pride borne ignorance think enjoyment would continue giving happiness a soul state not comprehend god owner thus not surrender unto willonly proper knowledge god false notion enjoyer removed it necessary realize god alone owner material energy needs used service he master entire creation souls eternal servants the souls give attitude pride develop attitude selfless service lord this achieved understanding true nature self eternal servant eliminating material attachments pull us towards world away the padma purāṇ states dāsa bhūtamidaṁ tasya jagatsthāvara jangamamśhrīmannārāyaṇa swāmī jagatānprabhurīśhwaraḥ the supreme lord narayan controller lord world all moving nonmoving beings entities creation his servants hence desire serve god increases illusion enjoyer prakṛiti material world gets gradually eliminated heart cleansed jagadguru shree kripaluji maharaj emphasizes everything else powerful means purifying heart sau bātana kī bāta ika dharu muralīdhara dhyāna baṛhavahu sevāvāsanā yaha sau jñānana jñāna bhakti śhatak verse out hundred advice purification important let mind absorbed divine fluteplayer shree krishna keep increasing desire serve him this counsel important hundred gems knowledge but happens etheric hearts cleansed become perfectly situated loving service lord in verse shree krishna says perfected souls enter spiritual realm stay forever once state godrealization achieved material realm serves purpose soul free cycle life death it stays god divine abode along perfected godrealized souls the material realm onefourth spiritual realm threefourths entire creation as city prison occupies small part large city similarly material realm small part god vast creation the vedas state pādo sya viśhwā bhūtāni tripādasya amṛitam divi puruṣh sūktam mantra this temporary world made material energy one part creation the three parts eternal abode god beyond phenomenon life death in next verse shree krishna explains nature eternal abode
15,6,न तद्भासयते सूर्यो न शशाङ्को न पावक: | यद्गत्वा न निवर्तन्ते तद्धाम परमं मम ॥6॥,"Neither the sun nor the moon nor fire illumines That. That is My Supreme Abode, reaching which they do not return.","Here, Lord Shree Krishna briefly describes his divine Abode, which he says is self-luminous. No sun, moon or fire is required to light it up. As the material realm is created by Maya (material energy), it is full of defects and dualities. Whereas, the divine realm is created by Yogmaya (spiritual energy), which is both transcendental and perfect. It is also described as sat-chit-ānand (full of bliss, knowledge, and eternality).The Paravyom is the spiritual sky of the divine realm. It is filled with splendor and divine opulence. It contains numerous abodes of various eternal forms of God. Narayan, Ram, Shree Krishna, etc. all have their separate Abodes.  They reside there eternally along with their devotees and perform divine Leelas (Pastimes). In a prayer to Shree Krishna Brahma says:goloka-nāmni nija-dhāmni tale cha tasyadevī maheśha-hari-dhāmasu teṣhu teṣhute te prabhāva-nichayā vihitāśh cha yenagovindam ādi-puruṣhaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi(Brahma Samhitā verse 43)“In the spiritual sky is Golok, the personal Abode of Shree Krishna.  That spiritual sky also contains the Abodes of Narayan, Shiv, Durga, etc.  I adore Supreme Divine Personality Lord Krishna, by the majesty of whose opulence, this is possible.” Brahma has further described Golok in the following verse:ānanda-chinmaya-rasa-pratibhāvitābhistābhir ya eva nija-rūpatayā kalābhiḥgoloka eva nivasaty akhilātma-bhūtogovindam ādi-puruṣhaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi(Brahma Samhitā verse 37)“I worship Govind, the Supreme Lord, who resides in Golok with the expansion of His own form, Radha.  Their eternal Associates are the sakhis, who are enlivened by the ever-blissful spiritual energy and are the embodiments of sixty-four artistic abilities.” Shree Krishna assures Arjun that souls who attain him, reside eternally with him in His Supreme Abode, which is perfect in every way.

15,7,ममैवांशो जीवलोके जीवभूत: सनातन: | मन:षष्ठानीन्द्रियाणि प्रकृतिस्थानि कर्षति ॥7॥,"It is verily a part of Mine which, becoming the eternal individual soul in the region of living beings, draws (to itself) the organs which have the mind as their sixth, and which abide in Nature.","In the previous verse, Shree Krishna explained that all the perfected souls who find Him go to His Abode and never return to the material world. Now in this verse he says, but those who remain in the material world are also His Anśha or fragmental parts.Are the embodied souls also a part of God? To understand this, we must first look at what are the different forms in which God manifests. There are mainly two forms:Swānśh:  All the direct forms of God, who are His integrated parts and not different from Lord Shree Krishna are called swānśh. They are also known as His Avatars such as Shree Ram, Narshingh Bhagavan, Varaha, Matsya, etc.Vibhinnānśh:  All the souls of existence come under this category; they are not directly His parts. These take form from His material energy or jīva śhakti. Shree Krishna had previously explained this in Verse 7.5 “But beyond the material energy, O mighty-armed Arjun, there is another superior energy of Mine.  It is the embodied souls who are the basis of life in this world.”These vibhinnānśh souls are further divided into three kinds: Nitya Siddha:  The liberated souls, who have always resided in the divine realm of God since eternity and participate in His divine Pastimes.Sādhan Siddha:  Those souls from the material world, who practiced sādhanā and attained the Supreme Lord.  And now they reside in the divine realm for the rest of eternity.Nitya Baddha:  The embodied souls who have been trapped in the material realm since eternity.  Due to their material existence, these souls are dis-illusioned by their five senses and the mind. They are struggling in samsara; the cycle of birth and death. The Kaṭhopaniṣhad states:parāñchi khāni vyatṛiṇat swayambhūḥ   (2.1.1)“The creator, Brahma, has made the senses such that they are turned outward toward the world.” Therefore, Shree Krishna said for the vibhinnānśh nitya baddha parts, “Bound by their material nature, these souls are struggling with the six senses including the mind.” In the next verse, He explains when a soul moves from one body to another upon death, what happens to the mind and the senses.",in previous verse shree krishna explained perfected souls find him go his abode never return material world now verse says remain material world also his anśha fragmental partsare embodied souls also part god to understand must first look different forms god manifests there mainly two forms swānśh all direct forms god his integrated parts not different lord shree krishna called swānśh they also known his avatars shree ram narshingh bhagavan varaha matsya etcvibhinnānśh all souls existence come category not directly his parts these take form his material energy jīva śhakti shree krishna previously explained verse but beyond material energy o mightyarmed arjun another superior energy mine it embodied souls basis life world these vibhinnānśh souls divided three kinds nitya siddha the liberated souls always resided divine realm god since eternity participate his divine pastimessādhan siddha those souls material world practiced sādhanā attained supreme lord and reside divine realm rest eternitynitya baddha the embodied souls trapped material realm since eternity due material existence souls disillusioned five senses mind they struggling samsara cycle birth death the kaṭhopaniṣhad states parāñchi khāni vyatṛiṇat swayambhūḥ the creator brahma made senses turned outward toward world therefore shree krishna said vibhinnānśh nitya baddha parts bound material nature souls struggling six senses including mind in next verse he explains soul moves one body another upon death happens mind senses
15,8,शरीरं यदवाप्नोति यच्चाप्युत्क्रामतीश्वर: | गृहीत्वैतानि संयाति वायुर्गन्धानिवाशयात् ॥8॥,"When the master leaves it and even when he assumes a body, he departs taking these, as wind (carries away) odours from their receptacles.","Here, Shree Krishna has given the example of the breeze to explain the process of transmigration of a soul from one body into another. Similar to the breeze, which carries with it the fragrances of the flowers, upon the death of the gross body, the soul carries with it the subtle and the causal bodies, these include the senses and the mind. (The concept of three kinds of bodies has been explained in detail in Verse 2.28).Even when the material body dies, the soul continues to carry the mind along with the experiences of its past lifetimes from its former body to the new one. That explicates why people who are born blind can still dream, probably based on their experiences from past lives. Dreams are considered to be a visual representation of what we see or think during waking hours. It might be in a distorted or rambled form, which gets connected in our mind when we sleep. For example, someone saw a bird flying and thought, “How wonderful will it be to fly like a bird!” Sometime later, he dreams that he is flying in his human body itself. Yet, a blind person who has not seen anything from birth dreams, this can only be due to all the impressions that are stored in the subconscious mind, which it carries with it from past lifetimes.In the next verse, Shree Krishna explains what the soul does with the mind and senses it takes with it when it departs from its present body.",here shree krishna given example breeze explain process transmigration soul one body another similar breeze carries fragrances flowers upon death gross body soul carries subtle causal bodies include senses mind the concept three kinds bodies explained detail verse even material body dies soul continues carry mind along experiences past lifetimes former body new one that explicates people born blind still dream probably based experiences past lives dreams considered visual representation see think waking hours it might distorted rambled form gets connected mind sleep for example someone saw bird flying thought how wonderful fly like bird sometime later dreams flying human body yet blind person not seen anything birth dreams due impressions stored subconscious mind carries past lifetimesin next verse shree krishna explains soul mind senses takes departs present body
15,9,श्रोत्रं चक्षु: स्पर्शनं च रसनं घ्राणमेव च | अधिष्ठाय मनश्चायं विषयानुपसेवते ॥9॥,"This one enjoys the objects by presiding over the ear, eyes, skin and tongue as also the nose and the mind.","The soul is divine, then how does it savor the objects of the senses? With the help of the mind and the senses, it can enjoy taste, smell, touch, feel or hear sounds. Even though the mind and senses are lifeless, due to the consciousness of the soul they become lifelike. This helps them to experience pleasure and pain from their thoughts, situations, persons, and objects of the senses. Then the embodied soul identifies the same experiences of the mind and the senses as its own because of the ego.The trouble here is, that the happiness experienced through the mind and the senses is material, but the soul is divine. Hence, regardless of the amount, the soul can never be satisfied with such material pleasures. It is restless and continuously keeps searching for that ultimate source of happiness. Ralph Waldo Emerson an American philosopher very beautifully said, “We grant that human life is mean.  But how did we find out that it is mean?  What is the ground of this uneasiness, of this old discontent?  What is this universal sense of want and ignorance, but the fine innuendo by which the soul makes its enormous claim?” Another famous philosopher, Meister Eckhart has written: “There is something in the soul which is above the living being, divine and simple. This light is only satisfied with the supra essential essence.” The divine bliss, which is both eternal and infinite; that the uncontended soul is continuously searching for; can only be attained from God. Those who realize that the mind and the senses are the cause of bondage, and the only way to break free is to turn these instruments of senses towards God, progresses on the path of devotion. Saint Tulsidas, the author of Ramayana in Hindi (Awadhi) is an excellent example.As a young lad, he was madly in love with his wife. Once she went for a few days to her parents’ house, which was in a nearby village across a stream. At night, the weather was bad, but Tulsidas was very restless and eager to meet her. He decided to go and meet her right away. It was very dark and raining, so no boatman was willing to take him across the stream. Then he saw something floating nearby, thinking that it was a log, he clung to it and swam across.  When he reached her house, it was late, he was hesitant to wake the entire household. His wife’s room was on the second floor, he thought of calling out to her, but saw a rope hanging from her window. He caught that and went up to her room.She was astonished to see him there and enquired how he managed to come that late at night, in such terrible weather. He pointed at the window, but when they looked out of the window, both were shocked. There was no rope it was a snake, and what Tulsidas assumed to be a log, was in fact, a floating dead body. His desire for his wife was so intense that it had blinded his mind. She was furious and said to him, “You desire me, a body made of flesh and blood. If you would have such an intense desire for God, you would attain him and be free from the cycle of life and death.”Her words had a life-changing effect on Tulsidas. He left home, renounced a householders’ life and took up devotion. By detaching himself from the material pleasures and engaging them towards devotion to God, he went on to become a great saint and poet. He later wrote:kāmihi nāri piāri jimi lobhihi priya jimi dāma,timi raghunātha nirantara priya lāgahu mohi rāma(Ramayan)“As a lustful man desires a beautiful woman, and as an avaricious person desires wealth, may my mind and senses constantly desire Lord Ram.”",the soul divine savor objects senses with help mind senses enjoy taste smell touch feel hear sounds even though mind senses lifeless due consciousness soul become lifelike this helps experience pleasure pain thoughts situations persons objects senses then embodied soul identifies experiences mind senses egothe trouble happiness experienced mind senses material soul divine hence regardless amount soul never satisfied material pleasures it restless continuously keeps searching ultimate source happiness ralph waldo emerson american philosopher beautifully said we grant human life mean but find mean what ground uneasiness old discontent what universal sense want ignorance fine innuendo soul makes enormous claim another famous philosopher meister eckhart written there something soul living divine simple this light satisfied supra essential essence the divine bliss eternal infinite uncontended soul continuously searching attained god those realize mind senses cause bondage way break free turn instruments senses towards god progresses path devotion saint tulsidas author ramayana hindi awadhi excellent exampleas young lad madly love wife once went days parents house nearby village across stream at night weather bad tulsidas restless eager meet he decided go meet right away it dark raining boatman willing take across stream then saw something floating nearby thinking log clung swam across when reached house late hesitant wake entire household his wife room second floor thought calling saw rope hanging window he caught went roomshe astonished see enquired managed come late night terrible weather he pointed window looked window shocked there rope snake tulsidas assumed log fact floating dead body his desire wife intense blinded mind she furious said you desire body made flesh blood if would intense desire god would attain free cycle life death her words lifechanging effect tulsidas he left home renounced householders life took devotion by detaching material pleasures engaging towards devotion god went become great saint poet he later wrote kāmihi nāri piāri jimi lobhihi priya jimi dāma timi raghunātha nirantara priya lāgahu mohi rāma ramayan as lustful man desires beautiful woman avaricious person desires wealth may mind senses constantly desire lord ram
15,10,उत्क्रामन्तं स्थितं वापि भुञ्जानं वा गुणान्वितम् | विमूढा नानुपश्यन्ति पश्यन्ति ज्ञानचक्षुष: ॥10॥,"Persons who are diversely deluded do not see it even when it is leaving or residing (in this body), or experiencing, or in association with the qualities. Those with the eye of knowledge see.","The soul savors the perceptions of the mind and the senses while it resides within a body, but not everyone can understand this. It is a spiritual object and cannot be seen or touched using material senses. Several experiments have been conducted by scientists to find the soul, but the material instruments of the laboratories are no good to detect it. Hence, they conclude that all the bodily parts working together are the source of life.It is similar to a newbie mechanic trying to figure out how does a car move. He looks at the movement of the wheels, traces that back to the accelerator, then the steering wheel and the ignition switch. He concludes that all these parts make a car move. But he missed the important part, who starts the ignition and moves the steering wheel? Unless a driver operates the car, it would not move. Similarly, devoid of spiritual knowledge about the existence of the soul and its functions, the physiologists’ theory is that the physical body itself along with its different parts is the source of life.In this verse, Shree Krishna has said that the ignorant (vimūḍh) are unaware of their own divine identity and presume the physical body to be the self.  Only someone who has acquired spiritual knowledge understands that it is the soul that gives life to the body. Without the soul, the body is lifeless. When a person dies, the material parts of the body; the heart, brain, lungs, limbs, etc. are there, but they don’t function, as the soul has left the body.Consciousness is an indication of life or the presence of a soul in a physical body. When the soul departs, consciousness ends. Only those who have acquired the eyes of knowledge (jñāna chakṣhu) can understand this phenomenon.",the soul savors perceptions mind senses resides within body not everyone understand it spiritual object not seen touched using material senses several experiments conducted scientists find soul material instruments laboratories good detect hence conclude bodily parts working together source lifeit similar newbie mechanic trying figure car move he looks movement wheels traces back accelerator steering wheel ignition switch he concludes parts make car move but missed important part starts ignition moves steering wheel unless driver operates car would not move similarly devoid spiritual knowledge existence soul functions physiologists theory physical body along different parts source lifein verse shree krishna said ignorant vimūḍh unaware divine identity presume physical body self only someone acquired spiritual knowledge understands soul gives life body without soul body lifeless when person dies material parts body heart brain lungs limbs etc function soul left bodyconsciousness indication life presence soul physical body when soul departs consciousness ends only acquired eyes knowledge jñāna chakṣhu understand phenomenon
15,11,यतन्तो योगिनश्चैनं पश्यन्त्यात्मन्यवस्थितम् | यतन्तोऽप्यकृतात्मानो नैनं पश्यन्त्यचेतस: ॥11॥,And the yogis who are diligent see this one as existing in themselves. The non-discriminating ones who lack self-control do not see this one-though (they be) diligent.,"Only acquiring knowledge is not sufficient, it must also be in the proper direction. The common flaw with the human approach is that we tend to use our material senses to understand the divine. We want to decide the correctness and faults in knowledge with our intellect, which has only worldly but no experience of the divine. We believe that things which cannot be perceived by the mind and the senses do not exist.This approach is well elucidated by Noble laureate and French physiologist, Alexis Carrel. In his book, Man the Unknown, he states: “Our mind has a natural tendency to reject the things that do not fit into the frame of scientific or philosophical beliefs of our time.  After all, scientists are only human.   They are saturated with the prejudices of their environment and epoch.  They willingly believe that facts which cannot be explained by current theories do not exist.  At present times, scientists still look upon telepathy and other metaphysical phenomena as illusions.  Evident facts having an unorthodox appearance are suppressed.”According to Nyāya Darśhan, one of the ancient schools of Hindu philosophy, such thinking is called kūpa-maṇḍūka-nyāya (the logic of a well-frog).  The story behind this is of a frog which has been living within the walls of a well, unaware of the world outside. Once an ocean frog gets washed off and falls into that well. The well-frog enquires to the newcomer, “How big is the ocean, where you lived?” The ocean frog replied, “It is huge.” The well-frog said, “It must be 5 times bigger than this well.” To this, the ocean frog said, “No much bigger than that.” The well-frog said, “Is it 10 times bigger?” “Much more than that,” said the ocean frog. The well-frog was now curious and said, “A hundred times?” To this, the ocean frog replied, “A hundred is nothing, the ocean is much bigger than that.” The frog from the well did not believe the ocean frog and said, “You are a liar, how can any place be a hundred times bigger than my well?” The well-frog had been living there its whole life, it had not seen anything beyond the walls of that well. Therefore, its mind could not comprehend the idea of a vast ocean, or the world that existed outside of that well.Like the frog of the well, materialistic people cannot perceive the idea of an eternal soul. Due to their limited experience and lack of spiritual knowledge, they cannot perceive that there is an entire spiritual universe beyond the understanding of their material intellects. Only those who have taken the path of spirituality, endeavor to purify their hearts with humility and faith. A cleansed mind naturally experiences the presence of the soul. Then the knowledge of the scriptures becomes clear to them.Similar to the existence of the soul, the senses cannot perceive the existence of God as well. Only through the eyes of knowledge can one realize God. In the next verse, Shree Krishna has briefed on the method of perceiving the existence of God.",only acquiring knowledge not sufficient must also proper direction the common flaw human approach tend use material senses understand divine we want decide correctness faults knowledge intellect worldly experience divine we believe things not perceived mind senses not existthis approach well elucidated noble laureate french physiologist alexis carrel in book man unknown states our mind natural tendency reject things not fit frame scientific philosophical beliefs time after scientists human they saturated prejudices environment epoch they willingly believe facts not explained current theories not exist at present times scientists still look upon telepathy metaphysical phenomena illusions evident facts unorthodox appearance suppressed according nyāya darśhan one ancient schools hindu philosophy thinking called kūpamaṇḍūkanyāya logic wellfrog the story behind frog living within walls well unaware world outside once ocean frog gets washed falls well the wellfrog enquires newcomer how big ocean lived the ocean frog replied it huge the wellfrog said it must times bigger well to ocean frog said no much bigger that the wellfrog said is times bigger much said ocean frog the wellfrog curious said a hundred times to ocean frog replied a hundred nothing ocean much bigger that the frog well not believe ocean frog said you liar place hundred times bigger well the wellfrog living whole life not seen anything beyond walls well therefore mind could not comprehend idea vast ocean world existed outside welllike frog well materialistic people not perceive idea eternal soul due limited experience lack spiritual knowledge not perceive entire spiritual universe beyond understanding material intellects only taken path spirituality endeavor purify hearts humility faith a cleansed mind naturally experiences presence soul then knowledge scriptures becomes clear themsimilar existence soul senses not perceive existence god well only eyes knowledge one realize god in next verse shree krishna briefed method perceiving existence god
15,12,यदादित्यगतं तेजो जगद्भासयतेऽखिलम् | यच्चन्द्रमसि यच्चाग्नौ तत्तेजो विद्धि मामकम् ॥12॥,"That light in the sun which illumines the whole world, that which is in the moon, and that which is in fire, -know that light to be Mine.","In the human form, we tend to forget our origin and eternal form. We regard ourselves as the physical body and get attracted to our bodily relations; parents, spouse, children, material wealth, etc. We feel they are the most significant. We also forget that it is God who is the creator and sustainer of the entire universe.In this verse, Lord Shree Krishna has said that the entire creation; is the manifestation of his energy. Even the Sun gets its radiance from him. According to scientific theories, the energy emitted every second by the sun is equivalent to millions of nuclear power plants put together, and it has been an uninterrupted process for billions of years. Yet this energy has not reduced in any way. The glory and brilliance of the sun are a part of God’s wonderful creation.Similarly, the night sky is lit up by the moon. Though our mundane intellect might want us to believe and it is also scientifically concluded that moonshine is due to the reflection of the sun’s light. But the periodic movement of the moon is also part of God’s amazing creation. The sun, the moon, the planets, stars, the panch mahabhootas (earth, water, air, fire, and ether); in fact, the entire universe is a manifestation of God’s vibhūtis (opulence). It would be very naïve to think that such an amazing celestial arrangement is a result of some random big bang.There is a story in Kenopanishad, which explicates this. Once there was a prolonged war between the devatās (celestial gods) and the daityas (demons from the nether regions). Eventually, the devatās won by the grace of God. But their pride made them think that it was due to their own strength. God wanted to teach them a lesson; He manifested as an effulgent and powerful yakṣha (a semi-celestial being) in the celestial sky.When Indra, the King of Heaven saw this yakṣha, he felt insecure and intimidated. To find out who this yakṣha was, he sent Agni, the fire god. With great pride, Agni challenged the yakṣha and said, “I am the fire god, and possess the power to burn the entire world within seconds, please reveal yourself.” The yakṣha put in front of him a piece of straw and asked if he could burn it. Agni laughed, “Can a blade of grass be a test for my immense power? Let that be.” But when he moved forward to burn it, he could not and started feeling very cold himself. God had taken away his power, defeated and embarrassed he ran back to Indra.Next, Indra sent Vayu, the wind god to inquire who this yakṣha was. He went to the yakṣha and said, “I am the wind god and possess the power to turn the world upside down within a few seconds, reveal who you are?” Again, the yakṣha put a piece of straw in front of Vayu and said, “Turn this over if you can?” Vayu smirked with pride and tried to blow it, but could not. He felt powerless, and with great effort, he returned to Indra exhausted.Now Indra was raged and came to challenge the yakṣha himself. But by then the yakṣha had disappeared and in his place was seated Goddess Uma, God’s divine Yogmaya power. A baffled Indra asked her, “O Divine Mother, please tell me who was that powerful yakṣha?” She answered, “O imprudent child, you could not recognize Him? Your pride had blinded your prudence. He was your Supreme Father, your creator, and power source, without him you would be powerless.” Realizing his mistake, Indra begged for forgiveness.",in human form tend forget origin eternal form we regard physical body get attracted bodily relations parents spouse children material wealth etc we feel significant we also forget god creator sustainer entire universein verse lord shree krishna said entire creation manifestation energy even sun gets radiance according scientific theories energy emitted every second sun equivalent millions nuclear power plants put together uninterrupted process billions years yet energy not reduced way the glory brilliance sun part god wonderful creationsimilarly night sky lit moon though mundane intellect might want us believe also scientifically concluded moonshine due reflection sun light but periodic movement moon also part god amazing creation the sun moon planets stars panch mahabhootas earth water air fire ether fact entire universe manifestation god vibhūtis opulence it would naïve think amazing celestial arrangement result random big bangthere story kenopanishad explicates once prolonged war devatās celestial gods daityas demons nether regions eventually devatās grace god but pride made think due strength god wanted teach lesson he manifested effulgent powerful yakṣha semicelestial celestial skywhen indra king heaven saw yakṣha felt insecure intimidated to find yakṣha sent agni fire god with great pride agni challenged yakṣha said i fire god possess power burn entire world within seconds please reveal yourself the yakṣha put front piece straw asked could burn agni laughed can blade grass test immense power let be but moved forward burn could not started feeling cold god taken away power defeated embarrassed ran back indranext indra sent vayu wind god inquire yakṣha he went yakṣha said i wind god possess power turn world upside within seconds reveal again yakṣha put piece straw front vayu said turn vayu smirked pride tried blow could not he felt powerless great effort returned indra exhaustednow indra raged came challenge yakṣha but yakṣha disappeared place seated goddess uma god divine yogmaya power a baffled indra asked o divine mother please tell powerful yakṣha she answered o imprudent child could not recognize him your pride blinded prudence he supreme father creator power source without would powerless realizing mistake indra begged forgiveness

Here, gām means earth, and ojasā is energy. Like all other celestial bodies, the earth is also a big mass of matter. But God has made it habitable, so that, it can sustain life. Ever wondered, why ocean water is so salty? God could have made the oceans full of freshwater, but it would have become a breeding ground for diseases. Due to the high salt content of the ocean water, many disease-causing microorganisms cannot survive in it, thereby protecting life. Similarly, several such amazing phenomena make earth inhabitable to a variety of species, of both movable, and static living beings. Nobel laureate and famous American scientist, George Wald has written in his book, A Universe that Breeds Life: “If anyone of the considerable number of the physical properties of our universe were other than they are, then life, that now appears to be so prevalent, would be impossible, here or anywhere.” Shree Krishna also says that the moonlight gets its nourishing properties from Him. And it is the ambrosial nectar of the moonlight that nourishes the entire plant life, i.e. fruits, vegetables, grains, herbs, etc.",in verse shree krishna said his energy brought appropriate physical conditions life exist planet earth here gām means earth ojasā energy like celestial bodies earth also big mass matter but god made habitable sustain life ever wondered ocean water salty god could made oceans full freshwater would become breeding ground diseases due high salt content ocean water many diseasecausing microorganisms not survive thereby protecting life similarly several amazing phenomena make earth inhabitable variety species movable static living beings nobel laureate famous american scientist george wald written book a universe breeds life if anyone considerable number physical properties universe life appears prevalent would impossible anywhere shree krishna also says moonlight gets nourishing properties him and ambrosial nectar moonlight nourishes entire plant life ie fruits vegetables grains herbs etc
15,14,अहं वैश्वानरो भूत्वा प्राणिनां देहमाश्रित: | प्राणापानसमायुक्त: पचाम्यन्नं चतुर्विधम् ॥14॥,"Taking the form of Vaisvanara and residing in the bodies of creatures, I, in association with Prana and Apana, digest the four kinds of food.","Shree Krishna says that God exists inside all living beings as vaiśhvānara, meaning “fire of digestion,” which is ignited by the power of God.  The Bṛihadāraṇyak Upaniṣhad has also stated:ayam agnir vaiśhvānaro yo ’yam antaḥ puruṣheyenedam annaṁ achyate (5.9.1) “God is the fire inside the stomach that enables living beings to digest food.” Though the scientific community has concluded, that the organs of the digestive system such as the stomach, liver, pancreas, gall bladder, etc. secrete digestive juices enabling the digestion of food in living beings. This revelation by God suggests that such an approach is naïve. It is God’s energy which fires up the digestive process in living beings.Chaturvidham means four types and annam means food. Food is categorized into four types: 1. Bhojya - Foods that are chewed, such as bread, chapatti, etc.  2. Peya - These are mostly liquid or semi-solid foods which we have to swallow or drink, such as milk, juice, etc.  3. Kośhya - Foods that are sucked, such as sugarcane.  4. Lehya - This includes foods that are licked, such as honey, etc.In the last few verses, Shri Krishna has explicated how God supports every aspect of our life. With his energy, He makes the earth habitable, nourishes all vegetation, and even ignites the gastric fire to digest our food. In the next verse, he concludes by stating that He is the master of all knowledge.",shree krishna says god exists inside living beings vaiśhvānara meaning fire digestion ignited power god the bṛihadāraṇyak upaniṣhad also stated ayam agnir vaiśhvānaro yo yam antaḥ puruṣheyenedam annaṁ achyate god fire inside stomach enables living beings digest food though scientific community concluded organs digestive system stomach liver pancreas gall bladder etc secrete digestive juices enabling digestion food living beings this revelation god suggests approach naïve it god energy fires digestive process living beingschaturvidham means four types annam means food food categorized four types bhojya foods chewed bread chapatti etc peya these mostly liquid semisolid foods swallow drink milk juice etc kośhya foods sucked sugarcane lehya this includes foods licked honey etcin last verses shri krishna explicated god supports every aspect life with energy he makes earth habitable nourishes vegetation even ignites gastric fire digest food in next verse concludes stating he master knowledge
15,15,सर्वस्य चाहं हृदि सन्निविष्टो मत्त: स्मृतिर्ज्ञानमपोहनं च | वेदैश्च सर्वैरहमेव वेद्यो वेदान्तकृद्वेदविदेव चाहम् ॥15॥,"And I am seated in the hearts of all. From Me are memory, knowledge and their loss. I alone am the object to be known through all the Vedas; I am also the originator of the Vedanta, and I Myself am the knower of the Vedas.","In this verse, Lord Shree Krishna says that He has bestowed upon us this amazing ability of memory and knowledge. While the mind and the intellect are like software; the brain can be considered hardware. Yet this mechanism of the brain is way beyond human understanding.Although there is vast development in technology, there are many areas where the scientific community is still struggling. For example, surgeons who perform brain transplant get delighted with their feat; but do not fully understand its functions. Another example is of face-recognition technology. It is remarkable that humans can very easily recognize someone they meet after several years, even though there are many changes in their looks. Whereas, present-day computers sometimes cannot even recognize unchanged faces. How amazing it is that while the scanner software finds it difficult to read even typewritten text; humans can read even sketchy handwritings, without much effort. Such are the mysteries of the human brain which the Supreme Lord has created. Shree Krishna says that He has also given us this power of forgetting the past. Similar to how unwanted records are deleted from a computer, living beings wipe off unwanted memories. Else there would be an information overload. Uddhav says to Shree Krishna:  tvatto jñānaṁ hi jīvānāṁ pramoṣhas te ’tra śhaktitaḥ  (Bhagavatam 11.22.28)“From You alone, the knowledge of the living being arises, and by Your potency that knowledge is stolen away.” Other than the internal knowledge that we carry, there is another source of knowledge; that is from the scriptures. In this verse, the Lord has further revealed his glories in regards to the manifestation of the Vedas; that he is the creator, knower, and writer of the Vedas. God is divine and all his creations, including the Vedas, are divine. He alone is the knower of their true meaning; and only by his grace can a fortunate soul know the Vedas. Ved Vyas the author of the Vedānt Darśhan is considered to be an avatar of God. And Shree Krishna has specifically mentioned that he is the author of the Vedānt. Eventually, He says that although the Vedas give out numerous instructions both material and spiritual, the final objective of all knowledge is to know Him. The purpose of the rituals and ceremonies instructed are to lure people back from the material world towards spirituality. They act as an intermediate step to detach them from their materialistic mindset and direct them towards God. The Kaṭhopaniṣhad (1.2.15) states: sarve vedā yat padamāmananti  “All the Vedic mantras are actually pointing towards God.” Memorizing and reciting the Vedic mantras in proper meter, following all the rituals, meditating or even awakening the kuṇḍalinī power; all will be worthless if we do not know God. Only those who have learned to truly love God, have understood the real teachings of all the Vedic scriptures. Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj states: sarva śhāstra sāra yaha govind rādhe, āṭhoṅ yām mana hari guru meṅ lagā de  (Rādhā Govind Geet) “The essence of all the scriptures is to engage your mind day and night in loving devotion to God and Guru.” In the next two verses, Shree Krishna has described the terms kṣhar, akṣhar, and Puruṣhottam and given proper perspective to the knowledge revealed so far.",in verse lord shree krishna says he bestowed upon us amazing ability memory knowledge while mind intellect like software brain considered hardware yet mechanism brain way beyond human understandingalthough vast development technology many areas scientific community still struggling for example surgeons perform brain transplant get delighted feat not fully understand functions another example facerecognition technology it remarkable humans easily recognize someone meet several years even though many changes looks whereas presentday computers sometimes not even recognize unchanged faces how amazing scanner software finds difficult read even typewritten text humans read even sketchy handwritings without much effort such mysteries human brain supreme lord created shree krishna says he also given us power forgetting past similar unwanted records deleted computer living beings wipe unwanted memories else would information overload uddhav says shree krishna tvatto jñānaṁ hi jīvānāṁ pramoṣhas te tra śhaktitaḥ bhagavatam from you alone knowledge living arises your potency knowledge stolen away other internal knowledge carry another source knowledge scriptures in verse lord revealed glories regards manifestation vedas creator knower writer vedas god divine creations including vedas divine he alone knower true meaning grace fortunate soul know vedas ved vyas author vedānt darśhan considered avatar god and shree krishna specifically mentioned author vedānt eventually he says although vedas give numerous instructions material spiritual final objective knowledge know him the purpose rituals ceremonies instructed lure people back material world towards spirituality they act intermediate step detach materialistic mindset direct towards god the kaṭhopaniṣhad states sarve vedā yat padamāmananti all vedic mantras actually pointing towards god memorizing reciting vedic mantras proper meter following rituals meditating even awakening kuṇḍalinī power worthless not know god only learned truly love god understood real teachings vedic scriptures jagadguru shree kripaluji maharaj states sarva śhāstra sāra yaha govind rādhe āṭhoṅ yām mana hari guru meṅ lagā de rādhā govind geet the essence scriptures engage mind day night loving devotion god guru in next two verses shree krishna described terms kṣhar akṣhar puruṣhottam given proper perspective knowledge revealed far
15,16,द्वाविमौ पुरुषौ लोके क्षरश्चाक्षर एव च | क्षर: सर्वाणि भूतानि कूटस्थोऽक्षर उच्यते ॥16॥,There are these two persons in the world-the mutable and the immutable. The mutable consists of all things; the one existing as Maya is called the immutable.,"Shree Krishna says that there are two kinds of beings; the kṣhar (perishable) and the akṣhar (imperishable). All beings in the material realm are perishable, and those liberated are imperishable. Although all souls are eternal; in the material realm, Maya binds the individual soul to a material body. From the tiniest insect to the celestial gods, all embodied living entities in the material world are kṣhar (perishable). They have to go through the repetitive cycle of birth and death of their material body.Whereas, the akṣhar (imperishable) souls possess an immortal body, which is free from the cycle of birth and death. They reside forever in the divine realm; the Abode of God.",shree krishna says two kinds beings kṣhar perishable akṣhar imperishable all beings material realm perishable liberated imperishable although souls eternal material realm maya binds individual soul material body from tiniest insect celestial gods embodied living entities material world kṣhar perishable they go repetitive cycle birth death material bodywhereas akṣhar imperishable souls possess immortal body free cycle birth death they reside forever divine realm abode god
15,17,उत्तम: पुरुषस्त्वन्य: परमात्मेत्युदाहृत: | यो लोकत्रयमाविश्य बिभर्त्यव्यय ईश्वर: ॥17॥,"But different is the supreme Person who is spoken of as the transcendental Self, who, permeating the three worlds, upholds (them), and is the imperishable God.","In the previous verses, Shree Krishna spoke about the different worlds and categories of souls. Now he speaks of God - the Supreme Divine Personality called the Paramātma, which means the Supreme Soul. The appellation of Param emphasizes on the fact that Paramātmā is different from ātmā, which is an individual soul, whereas, Paramātmā is the Supreme Soul. He is the transcendental God who controls both the perishable and imperishable worlds. For the non-dualistic philosophers who propagate that individual soul itself is the Supreme Soul, this verse is clear disapproval of their claim. While the individual soul is very tiny and confined to the material body it resides in; the Supreme Soul is present inside every living entity. He is the constant companion of the individual soul in every life, immaterial of what species the soul gets born into. He sits in their hearts quietly taking a note; keeping an account of their karmas, and gives appropriate results.  For example, in a particular birth, a soul has received a dog’s body. The Supreme Soul continues to be inside and gives results based on the soul’s past karmas. This explains why even dogs have different destinies. Some dogs are born on the streets, live a famished life, and die in misery. Whereas, some get to live comfortably as pets in lavish mansions, living a dainty life. This huge difference in destiny is due to the stockpile of karmas from their previous births. The Supreme Soul which accompanies the soul in its various births, in different species, keeps granting results based on its karmas.The Supreme Soul also exists in a personal form as the four-armed Kshirodakshayi Vishnu, commonly known as “Bhagwan Vishnu”. A popular saying in Hindi goes: “mārane vāle ke do hāth, bachāne vāle ke chār hāth” which means, a killer has two arms, but the savior has four arms.  The four-armed personality referred to here is the Paramātmā, the Supreme Soul.",in previous verses shree krishna spoke different worlds categories souls now speaks god supreme divine personality called paramātma means supreme soul the appellation param emphasizes fact paramātmā different ātmā individual soul whereas paramātmā supreme soul he transcendental god controls perishable imperishable worlds for nondualistic philosophers propagate individual soul supreme soul verse clear disapproval claim while individual soul tiny confined material body resides supreme soul present inside every living entity he constant companion individual soul every life immaterial species soul gets born he sits hearts quietly taking note keeping account karmas gives appropriate results for example particular birth soul received dog body the supreme soul continues inside gives results based soul past karmas this explains even dogs different destinies some dogs born streets live famished life die misery whereas get live comfortably pets lavish mansions living dainty life this huge difference destiny due stockpile karmas previous births the supreme soul accompanies soul various births different species keeps granting results based karmasthe supreme soul also exists personal form fourarmed kshirodakshayi vishnu commonly known bhagwan vishnu a popular saying hindi goes mārane vāle ke hāth bachāne vāle ke chār hāth means killer two arms savior four arms the fourarmed personality referred paramātmā supreme soul
15,18,यस्मात्क्षरमतीतोऽहमक्षरादपि चोत्तम: | अतोऽस्मि लोके वेदे च प्रथित: पुरुषोत्तम: ॥18॥,"Since I am transcendental to the mutable and above even the immutable, hence I am well known in the world and in the Vedas as the supreme Person.","So far in this chapter, Shree Krishna has detailed that His opulence is the source of all the magnificence in nature, and in creating the visible universe he does not deplete Himself. In this verse, He has called Himself Puruṣhottam, the Divine Supreme Person who transcends over the material world, which includes both kṣhar the perishable and akṣhar the imperishable divine souls.   Does that mean the Puruṣhottam He has referred to and Lord Shree Krishna Himself are two different entities? To eliminate any such doubts, in this verse, while referring to Himself Shree Krishna has used the term aham (I), which is first person singular. He also said that the Vedas and the Smritis have described Him similarly:kṛiṣhṇa eva paro devas taṁ dhyāyet taṁ rasayet taṁ yajet taṁ bhajed(Gopāl Tāpani Upaniṣhad)“Lord Krishna is the Supreme Lord. Meditate upon Him, relish the bliss of His devotion, worship Him, and serve Him.” yo ’sau paraṁ brahma gopālaḥ(Gopāl Tāpani Upaniṣhad) “Gopal (Lord Krishna) is the Supreme Being.”Then the question arises, who are Lord Ram, Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva, and all the other Gods and Goddesses? They are all different manifestations of the same Bhagavān, the Supreme Divine Personality and should not be considered separate.",so far chapter shree krishna detailed his opulence source magnificence nature creating visible universe not deplete himself in verse he called himself puruṣhottam divine supreme person transcends material world includes kṣhar perishable akṣhar imperishable divine souls does mean puruṣhottam he referred lord shree krishna himself two different entities to eliminate doubts verse referring himself shree krishna used term aham i first person singular he also said vedas smritis described him similarly kṛiṣhṇa eva paro devas taṁ dhyāyet taṁ rasayet taṁ yajet taṁ bhajed gopāl tāpani upaniṣhad lord krishna supreme lord meditate upon him relish bliss his devotion worship him serve him yo sau paraṁ brahma gopālaḥ gopāl tāpani upaniṣhad gopal lord krishna supreme being then question arises lord ram lord vishnu lord shiva gods goddesses they different manifestations bhagavān supreme divine personality not considered separate
15,19,यो मामेवमसम्मूढो जानाति पुरुषोत्तमम् | स सर्वविद्भजति मां सर्वभावेन भारत ॥19॥,"O scion of the Bharata dynasty, he who, being free from delusion, knows Me the supreme Person thus, he is all-knowing and adores Me with his whole being.","As per the Shreemad Bhagavatam, there are three ways to realize God:vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvaṁ yaj jñānam advayambrahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śhabdyate   (1.2.11)“The knowers of the Truth have stated that there is only one Supreme Entity that manifests in three ways in the world—Brahman, Paramātmā, and Bhagavān.” This does not mean that these three are different entities, God is one, and these forms are only his manifestations.  As water exists in nature as ice, water, and steam that have different physical properties; but are forms of the same substance; likewise, God exists in three forms Brahman, the formless, omnipotent and omnipresent. The followers of jñāna-yoga worship God as Brahman. The aṣhṭāṅg-yoga seeks God as Paramātmā, the Supreme Soul who resides in the hearts of all living creatures. Whereas, Bhagavān is more personal and can be considered the sweetest among his form. Here, God manifests as a person and performs sweet Leelas (pastimes). The devotees of the Bhākti-yoga savor this form and immerse themselves in his loving bliss, as explained earlier in verse 12.2.In this chapter, Shree Krishna has described all three forms of God. But which of them is the most complete? Here, in this verse lies the answer. Shree Krishna says those who know Him as the Supreme Divine Personality and worship him as Bhagavān truly have complete knowledge of Him.Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj in his book Bhakti Śhatak has given a detailed explanation of why Bhagavān realization is the highest. He has quoted the same verse 1.2.11 of the Shreemad Bhagavatam and said:tīna rūp śhrī kṛiṣhṇa ko, vedavyās batāya,brahma aura paramātmā, aru bhagavān kahāya.   (Bhakti Śhatak verse 21)“Ved Vyas has declared that the Supreme Lord manifests in three ways—Brahman, Paramātmā, and Bhagavān.”  Then he goes on to describe these three manifestations of the Absolute Truth.sarvaśhakti sampann ho, śhakti vikāsa na hoya,sat chit ānanda rūp jo, brahma kahāve soya.   (Bhakti Śhatak verse 22)“As Brahman, the infinite energies of God are all latent.  He merely displays eternal knowledge and bliss.”sarvaśhakti sanyukta ho, nāma rūp guṇa hoya,līlā parikara rahit ho, paramātmā hai soya.   (Bhakti Śhatak verse 23) “As Paramātmā, God displays His Form, Name, and Virtues.  But He does not engage in Leelas, nor does He have associates.”sarvaśhakti prākaṭya ho, līlā vividha prakāra,viharata parikara sang jo, tehi bhagavān pukāra.   (Bhakti Śhatak verse 24)“The aspect of God in which He manifests all His energies and engages in various loving Pastimes with His devotees is called Bhagavān.”Through these verses, Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj has explicated that; while in His manifestation as Brahman and Paramātmā God does not reveal himself completely; but as Bhagavān, He manifests himself with all his Names, Forms, Virtues, Pastimes, Abodes, and Associates.  This complete realization of the Supreme Entity has also been explained earlier in verse 12.2, with the example of a train. Thus, those who seek God as Bhagavān, the Supreme Divine Personality can truly acquire complete knowledge of Him.",as per shreemad bhagavatam three ways realize god vadanti tat tattvavidas tattvaṁ yaj jñānam advayambrahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śhabdyate the knowers truth stated one supreme entity manifests three ways paramātmā bhagavān this not mean three different entities god one forms manifestations as water exists nature ice water steam different physical properties forms substance likewise god exists three forms brahman formless omnipotent omnipresent the followers jñānayoga worship god brahman the aṣhṭāṅgyoga seeks god paramātmā supreme soul resides hearts living creatures whereas bhagavān personal considered sweetest among form here god manifests person performs sweet leelas pastimes the devotees bhāktiyoga savor form immerse loving bliss explained earlier verse chapter shree krishna described three forms god but complete here verse lies answer shree krishna says know him supreme divine personality worship bhagavān truly complete knowledge himjagadguru shree kripaluji maharaj book bhakti śhatak given detailed explanation bhagavān realization highest he quoted verse shreemad bhagavatam said tīna rūp śhrī kṛiṣhṇa ko vedavyās batāya brahma aura paramātmā aru bhagavān kahāya bhakti śhatak verse ved vyas declared supreme lord manifests three paramātmā bhagavān then goes describe three manifestations absolute truthsarvaśhakti sampann ho śhakti vikāsa na hoya sat chit ānanda rūp jo brahma kahāve soya bhakti śhatak verse as brahman infinite energies god latent he merely displays eternal knowledge bliss sarvaśhakti sanyukta ho nāma rūp guṇa hoya līlā parikara rahit ho paramātmā hai soya bhakti śhatak verse as paramātmā god displays his form name virtues but he not engage leelas he associates sarvaśhakti prākaṭya ho līlā vividha prakāra viharata parikara sang jo tehi bhagavān pukāra bhakti śhatak verse the aspect god he manifests his energies engages various loving pastimes his devotees called bhagavān through verses jagadguru shree kripaluji maharaj explicated his manifestation brahman paramātmā god not reveal completely bhagavān he manifests names forms virtues pastimes abodes associates this complete realization supreme entity also explained earlier verse example train thus seek god bhagavān supreme divine personality truly acquire complete knowledge him

Finally, the realization of the Absolute Truth about Oneself and the Supreme Divine Personality, God. I assure you that whoever espouses this knowledge will be truly enlightened.

16,1,श्रीभगवानुवाच | अभयं सत्वसंशुद्धिर्ज्ञानयोगव्यवस्थिति: | दानं दमश्च यज्ञश्च स्वाध्यायस्तप आर्जवम् ॥1॥,"The Blessed Lord said: Fearlessness, purity of mind, persistence in knowledge and yoga, charity and control of the external organs, sacrifice, (scriptural) study, austerity and rectitude;","Here, Shree Krishna describes twenty-six virtues of a saintly nature. These should be cultivated as a part of our spiritual practice for elevating ourselves to the supreme goal.Fearlessness. It is the state of freedom from concern for present and future miseries. Inordinate attachment of any kind causes fear. Attachment to wealth leads to dread of impoverishment, attachment to social prestige causes fear of infamy, attachment to vice leads to anxiety about the consequences of sin, attachment to bodily comfort causes the fear of ill-health, and so on. Detachment and surrender to God vanquish all fear from the heart.Purity of mind. This is the state of inner cleanliness. The mind generates and harbors thoughts, sentiments, feelings, emotions, etc. When these are ethical, wholesome, positive, and uplifting, the mind is considered pure, and when they are unethical and degrading, the mind is considered impure. Attachment to objects in the modes of passion and ignorance contaminate the mind, while attachment to God purifies it.Steadfastness in spiritual knowledge. It is said: tattva vismaraṇāt bhekivat [v1] “When human beings forget what is right and what is wrong they become like animals.” Thus, the path of virtue is forged by remaining steadfast in the awareness of spiritual principles.Charity. It refers to the giving away of one’s possessions for a good cause or to needy persons. True charity is that which is done, not with a feeling of superiority, but with a sense of gratefulness to God for the opportunity to help. Material charity, done for the welfare of the body, helps others temporarily. Spiritual charity, done at the platform of the soul, helps eliminate the cause of all suffering, which is separation from God. Consequently, it is considered higher than material charity.Control of the senses. The senses are notorious in their ability to drag the mind deeper into material illusion. They tempt the living being to seek immediate gratification. However, walking the path of virtue requires forsaking the lower sensual pleasures for achieving the higher goal. Thus, restraint of the senses is an essential virtue for treading the path to God.Sacrifice. It means executing one’s Vedic duties and social obligations, even though they may not be enjoyable. Sacrifice is considered perfect when it is done for the pleasure of God.Study of the sacred books. An important aspect of cultivating the divine nature is to feed the intellect with uplifting knowledge from the scriptures. When the intellect is illumined with proper knowledge, one’s actions naturally become sublime.Austerity. The body-mind-senses are such that, if we pamper them, they become pleasure-seeking, but if we restrain them, they become disciplined. Thus, austerity is the voluntary acceptance of hardships for purifying the body, mind, and intellect.Straightforwardness. Simplicity in speech and conduct unclutters the mind and engenders the sprouting of noble thoughts. The English phrase “simple living, high thinking” aptly expresses the benefits of the virtue of straightforwardness.Non-violence. It means not impeding the progressive life of other living beings through thought, word, or deed.Truthfulness. It means restraining oneself from distorting facts to suit one’s purpose. God is the Absolute Truth, and hence the practice of truthfulness takes us toward him; on the other hand, falsehood, while convenient, takes us away from God.Absence of anger. The manifestation of anger is a defect of the material mind. It takes place when the desires for happiness are obstructed and things do not turn out how one envisaged. By developing detachment and surrender to the will of God, one overcomes anger.Renunciation. The entire material energy belongs to God and it is meant for his pleasure. Hence, the opulences of the world are not for one’s enjoyment, but for being utilized in the service of God. To be fixed in this understanding is renunciation.Peacefulness. The cultivation of virtue requires mental poise. Peacefulness is the ability to retain inner equilibrium despite disturbing external situations.Restraint from fault-finding. The whole world and everything in it is a mixture of good and bad qualities. Focusing upon defects in others dirties our mind, while focusing upon their virtues purifies it. The nature of a saintly person is to see his or her own defects and observe the virtues of others.Compassion toward all living beings. As individuals evolve spiritually, they naturally rise above self-centeredness and develop empathy for all living beings. Compassion is the deep sympathy that arises upon seeing the sufferings of others.Absence of covetousness. Greed is the desire to accumulate more than what one legitimately needs for the maintenance of the body. Under its sway, people acquire huge amounts of wealth and possessions, though they know, that at the time of death, everything will be left behind. Freedom from such covetousness leads to contentment and inner peace.Gentleness. The disposition of behaving roughly with others arises from insensitivity to their feelings. But as one grows in spiritual stature, one naturally sheds crudeness in behavior. Gentleness is a sign of spiritual refinement.Modesty. Hrīḥ means “sense of guilt in performing actions contrary to the injunctions of scriptures and society.” The saintly nature is imbued with a ruthless inner conscience that gives one a sense of guilt in committing sinful acts.Lack of fickleness. We may begin with good intentions, but if we get distracted by temptations and hardships, we cannot complete the journey. Success on the path of virtue comes by unwaveringly pursuing the goal despite all diversions that come on the way.Vigor. From purity of mind comes a deep inner drive to act according to one’s values and beliefs. Hence, saintly personalities bring immense power and vigor to the tasks they pursue.Forgiveness or forbearance. This is the ability to tolerate the offences of others, without feeling the need to retaliate. Through forgiveness, one heals the emotional wounds caused by others that would otherwise fester and disturb the mind.Fortitude. It is the inner strength and determination in pursuing the goal, even when the mind and senses are wearied due to unfavorable circumstances. Most of the important things in the world have been accomplished by people who kept on trying when there seemed to be no hope at all. Sri Aurobindo put this very eloquently: “You have to be more persistent than the difficulty; there is no other way.”Cleanliness. It refers to both internal and external purity. Virtuous people believe in maintaining external cleanliness because it is conducive to internal purity. George Bernard Shaw said, “Better keep yourself clean and bright; you are the window through which you must see the world.”Bearing enmity toward none. Bearing enmity toward others poisons our own mind, and this becomes an impediment in the path of spiritual progress. The quality of freedom from hatred toward others is developed by realizing that they are also like us, and God resides in all.Absence of vanity. Self-praise, boastfulness, ostentation, etc. all stem from pride. Saintly personalities see nothing in themselves to be proud about, but instead, feel gratitude to God for the good qualities they possess. Thus, they refrain from self-aggrandizement.",here shree krishna describes twentysix virtues saintly nature these cultivated part spiritual practice elevating supreme goalfearlessness it state freedom

Hrīḥ means “sense of guilt in performing actions contrary to the injunctions of scriptures and society.” The saintly nature is imbued with a ruthless inner conscience that gives one a sense of guilt in committing sinful acts.Lack of fickleness. We may begin with good intentions, but if we get distracted by temptations and hardships, we cannot complete the journey. Success on the path of virtue comes by unwaveringly pursuing the goal despite all diversions that come on the way.Vigor. From purity of mind comes a deep inner drive to act according to one’s values and beliefs. Hence, saintly personalities bring immense power and vigor to the tasks they pursue.Forgiveness or forbearance. This is the ability to tolerate the offences of others, without feeling the need to retaliate. Through forgiveness, one heals the emotional wounds caused by others that would otherwise fester and disturb the mind.Fortitude. It is the inner strength and determination in pursuing the goal, even when the mind and senses are wearied due to unfavorable circumstances. Most of the important things in the world have been accomplished by people who kept on trying when there seemed to be no hope at all. Sri Aurobindo put this very eloquently: “You have to be more persistent than the difficulty; there is no other way.”Cleanliness. It refers to both internal and external purity. Virtuous people believe in maintaining external cleanliness because it is conducive to internal purity. George Bernard Shaw said, “Better keep yourself clean and bright; you are the window through which you must see the world.”Bearing enmity toward none. Bearing enmity toward others poisons our own mind, and this becomes an impediment in the path of spiritual progress. The quality of freedom from hatred toward others is developed by realizing that they are also like us, and God resides in all.Absence of vanity. Self-praise, boastfulness, ostentation, etc. all stem from pride. Saintly personalities see nothing in themselves to be proud about, but instead, feel gratitude to God for the good qualities they possess. Thus, they refrain from self-aggrandizement.",here shree krishna describes twentysix virtues saintly nature these cultivated part spiritual practice elevating supreme goalfearlessness it state freedom

16,3,तेज: क्षमा धृति: शौचमद्रोहोनातिमानिता | भवन्ति सम्पदं दैवीमभिजातस्य भारत ॥3॥,"Vigour, forgiveness, fortitude, purity, freedom from malice, absence of haughtiness-these, O scion of the Bharata dynasty, are (the qualities) of one born destined to have the divine nature.","Here, Shree Krishna describes twenty-six virtues of a saintly nature. These should be cultivated as a part of our spiritual practice for elevating ourselves to the supreme goal.Fearlessness. It is the state of freedom from concern for present and future miseries. Inordinate attachment of any kind causes fear. Attachment to wealth leads to dread of impoverishment, attachment to social prestige causes fear of infamy, attachment to vice leads to anxiety about the consequences of sin, attachment to bodily comfort causes the fear of ill-health, and so on. Detachment and surrender to God vanquish all fear from the heart.Purity of mind. This is the state of inner cleanliness. The mind generates and harbors thoughts, sentiments, feelings, emotions, etc. When these are ethical, wholesome, positive, and uplifting, the mind is considered pure, and when they are unethical and degrading, the mind is considered impure. Attachment to objects in the modes of passion and ignorance contaminate the mind, while attachment to God purifies it.Steadfastness in spiritual knowledge. It is said: tattva vismaraṇāt bhekivat [v1] “When human beings forget what is right and what is wrong they become like animals.” Thus, the path of virtue is forged by remaining steadfast in the awareness of spiritual principles.Charity. It refers to the giving away of one’s possessions for a good cause or to needy persons. True charity is that which is done, not with a feeling of superiority, but with a sense of gratefulness to God for the opportunity to help. Material charity, done for the welfare of the body, helps others temporarily. Spiritual charity, done at the platform of the soul, helps eliminate the cause of all suffering, which is separation from God. Consequently, it is considered higher than material charity.Control of the senses. The senses are notorious in their ability to drag the mind deeper into material illusion. They tempt the living being to seek immediate gratification. However, walking the path of virtue requires forsaking the lower sensual pleasures for achieving the higher goal. Thus, restraint of the senses is an essential virtue for treading the path to God.Sacrifice. It means executing one’s Vedic duties and social obligations, even though they may not be enjoyable. Sacrifice is considered perfect when it is done for the pleasure of God.Study of the sacred books. An important aspect of cultivating the divine nature is to feed the intellect with uplifting knowledge from the scriptures. When the intellect is illumined with proper knowledge, one’s actions naturally become sublime.Austerity. The body-mind-senses are such that, if we pamper them, they become pleasure-seeking, but if we restrain them, they become disciplined. Thus, austerity is the voluntary acceptance of hardships for purifying the body, mind, and intellect.Straightforwardness. Simplicity in speech and conduct unclutters the mind and engenders the sprouting of noble thoughts. The English phrase “simple living, high thinking” aptly expresses the benefits of the virtue of straightforwardness.Non-violence. It means not impeding the progressive life of other living beings through thought, word, or deed.Truthfulness. It means restraining oneself from distorting facts to suit one’s purpose. God is the Absolute Truth, and hence the practice of truthfulness takes us toward him; on the other hand, falsehood, while convenient, takes us away from God.Absence of anger. The manifestation of anger is a defect of the material mind. It takes place when the desires for happiness are obstructed and things do not turn out how one envisaged. By developing detachment and surrender to the will of God, one overcomes anger.Renunciation. The entire material energy belongs to God and it is meant for his pleasure. Hence, the opulences of the world are not for one’s enjoyment, but for being utilized in the service of God. To be fixed in this understanding is renunciation.Peacefulness. The cultivation of virtue requires mental poise. Peacefulness is the ability to retain inner equilibrium despite disturbing external situations.Restraint from fault-finding. The whole world and everything in it is a mixture of good and bad qualities. Focusing upon defects in others dirties our mind, while focusing upon their virtues purifies it. The nature of a saintly person is to see his or her own defects and observe the virtues of others.Compassion toward all living beings. As individuals evolve spiritually, they naturally rise above self-centeredness and develop empathy for all living beings. Compassion is the deep sympathy that arises upon seeing the sufferings of others.Absence of covetousness. Greed is the desire to accumulate more than what one legitimately needs for the maintenance of the body. Under its sway, people acquire huge amounts of wealth and possessions, though they know, that at the time of death, everything will be left behind. Freedom from such covetousness leads to contentment and inner peace.Gentleness. The disposition of behaving roughly with others arises from insensitivity to their feelings. But as one grows in spiritual stature, one naturally sheds crudeness in behavior. Gentleness is a sign of spiritual refinement.Modesty. Hrīḥ means “sense of guilt in performing actions contrary to the injunctions of scriptures and society.” The saintly nature is imbued with a ruthless inner conscience that gives one a sense of guilt in committing sinful acts.Lack of fickleness. We may begin with good intentions, but if we get distracted by temptations and hardships, we cannot complete the journey.

16,4,दम्भो दर्पोऽभिमानश्च क्रोध: पारुष्यमेव च | अज्ञानं चाभिजातस्य पार्थ सम्पदमासुरीम् ॥4॥,"O son of Prtha, (the attributes) of one destined to have the demoniacal nature are religious ostentation, pride and haughtiness, anger as also rudeness and ignorance.","Shree Krishna now expounds upon the six traits of those who possess demoniac natures. They are hypocrites, meaning they make an external show of virtuous behavior for impressing others, without possessing the matching internal traits. This creates an artificial Jekyll and Hyde personality, which is impure internally but has the external appearance of being pure.The behavior of demoniac natured people is arrogant and disrespectful to others. They are proud and conceited about their bodily possessions and designations, such as wealth, education, beauty, position, etc. They become angry when, due to lack of control of the mind, their lust and greed are frustrated. They are cruel and harsh, and devoid of sensitivity for others’ sufferings in their interactions with them. They have no understanding of the spiritual principles and hold unrighteousness to be righteousness.",shree krishna expounds upon six traits possess demoniac natures they hypocrites meaning make external show virtuous behavior impressing others without possessing matching internal traits this creates artificial jekyll hyde personality impure internally external appearance purethe behavior demoniac natured people arrogant disrespectful others they proud conceited bodily possessions designations wealth education beauty position etc they become angry due lack control mind lust greed frustrated they cruel harsh devoid sensitivity others sufferings interactions they understanding spiritual principles hold unrighteousness righteousness
16,5,दैवी सम्पद्विमोक्षाय निबन्धायासुरी मता | मा शुच: सम्पदं दैवीमभिजातोऽसि पाण्डव ॥5॥,"The divine nature is the Liberation, the demoniacal is considered to be for inevitable bondage. Do not grieve, O son of Pandu! You are destined to have the divine nature.","Having described the two kinds of natures, Shree Krishna now declares the consequences of both. He says that the demoniac qualities keep one fettered to the samsara of life and death, while the cultivation of saintly virtues helps one break through the bondage of Maya.To tread the spiritual path successfully and pursue it till the end, a sādhak (aspirant) needs to watch out for many things. If even one of the demoniac qualities, such as arrogance, hypocrisy, etc. remains in the personality, it can become the cause of failure. Simultaneously, the divine virtues need to be developed, for without the saintly qualities, our spiritual progress can again become crippled. For example, without fortitude, we will give up the journey when the going becomes difficult; without forgiveness, the mind will be tied down to hatred and not have the ability to be absorbed in God. But if we possess the saintly virtues that Shree Krishna mentions, then our ability to progress rapidly and cope with the obstacles on the path increases. Thus, developing good qualities and eliminating the bad ones is an integral part of spiritual practice. A useful technique that helps us work on removing our weaknesses and developing virtues is the maintenance of a personal diary. Many successful persons kept memoirs and diaries to help them develop the virtues they felt were necessary for success. Mahatma Gandhi and Benjamin Franklin both mention having used such techniques in their autobiographies.Some may argue that if we develop devotion to God, we will naturally, over time, acquire the saintly virtues described by Shree Krishna. That is indeed true, but it is unlikely that we will start out on the path full of devotion from the outset itself, free all the negative traits, any one of which can dramatically interfere with devotional progress. Most people need to slowly develop bhakti through practice, and success in practice will come by possessing saintly qualities and eliminating demoniac ones. Hence, as a part of our efforts in devotion, we must also keep working on ourselves to develop the divine qualities that Shree Krishna has mentioned in this chapter and shed any demoniac ones.",having described two kinds natures shree krishna declares consequences he says demoniac qualities keep one fettered samsara life death cultivation saintly virtues helps one break bondage mayato tread spiritual path successfully pursue till end sādhak aspirant needs watch many things if even one demoniac qualities arrogance hypocrisy etc remains personality become cause failure simultaneously divine virtues need developed without saintly qualities spiritual progress become crippled for example without fortitude give journey going becomes difficult without forgiveness mind tied hatred not ability absorbed god but possess saintly virtues shree krishna mentions ability progress rapidly cope obstacles path increases thus developing good qualities eliminating bad ones integral part spiritual practice a useful technique helps us work removing weaknesses developing virtues maintenance personal diary many successful persons kept memoirs diaries help develop virtues felt necessary success mahatma gandhi benjamin franklin mention used techniques autobiographiessome may argue develop devotion god naturally time acquire saintly virtues described shree krishna that indeed true unlikely start path full devotion outset free negative traits one dramatically interfere devotional progress most people need slowly develop bhakti practice success practice come possessing saintly qualities eliminating demoniac ones hence part efforts devotion must also keep working develop divine qualities shree krishna mentioned chapter shed demoniac ones
16,6,द्वौ भूतसर्गौ लोकेऽस्मिन्दैव आसुर एव च | दैवो विस्तरश: प्रोक्त आसुरं पार्थ मे शृणु ॥6॥,"In this world there are two (kinds of) creation of beings: the divine and the demoniacal. The divine has been spoken of elaborately. Hear about the demoniacal from Me, O son of Prtha.","All souls carry their natures with them from past lives. Accordingly, those cultivated virtuous qualities and performed meritorious deeds in the past lives are the ones who are born with divine natures, while those who indulged in sin and defiled their minds in previous lives carry the same tendencies into the present one. This explains the varieties of natures of living beings in the world. The divine and demoniac natures are the two extremes of this spectrum.The living beings in the celestial abodes possess more virtuous qualities, while the demoniac traits dominate in the lower abodes. Humans possess a mixture of both divine and demoniac traits. Even in the cruelest butcher, we sometimes find the quality of kindness existing in personal life. And even in elevated spiritual aspirants we find defects of virtue. It is said that in Satya-yug, the gods and demons lived on different planets (i.e., separate planes of existence); in Tretā-yug, they resided on the same planet; during Dwāpar-yug, they lived in the same family; and in Kali-yug, the godly and demoniac natures coexist in the same person’s heart. That is the dilemma of human existence, where the higher self pulls it upward toward God, while the lower self pulls it downward. Having described the saintly qualities, Shree Krishna now goes into an extended description of the lower nature, to help us recognize it and avoid it.",all souls carry natures past lives accordingly cultivated virtuous qualities performed meritorious deeds past lives ones born divine natures indulged sin defiled minds previous lives carry tendencies present one this explains varieties natures living beings world the divine demoniac natures two extremes spectrumthe living beings celestial abodes possess virtuous qualities demoniac traits dominate lower abodes humans possess mixture divine demoniac traits even cruelest butcher sometimes find quality kindness existing personal life and even elevated spiritual aspirants find defects virtue it said satyayug gods demons lived different planets ie separate planes existence tretāyug resided planet dwāparyug lived family kaliyug godly demoniac natures coexist person heart that dilemma human existence higher self pulls upward toward god lower self pulls downward having described saintly qualities shree krishna goes extended description lower nature help us recognize avoid
16,7,प्रवृत्तिं च निवृत्तिं च जना न विदुरासुरा: | न शौचं नापि चाचारो न सत्यं तेषु विद्यते ॥7॥,"Neither do the demoniacal persons under-stand what is to be done and what is not to be done; nor does purity, or even good conduct or truthfulness exist in them.","Dharma consists of codes of conduct that are conducive to one’s purification and the general welfare of all living beings. Adharma consists of prohibited actions that lead to degradation and cause harm to society. The demoniac nature is devoid of faith in the knowledge and wisdom of the scriptures. Hence, those under its sway are confused about what is right and wrong action.A typical example of this is the present trend in western philosophy. Having evolved through various schools of thought after the Renaissance, such as Age of Enlightenment, Humanism, Empiricism, Communism, Existentialism, and Skepticism, the present era in western philosophy is labeled as “Post-modernism.” The prevalent view of Post-modernist thought is that there is no absolute truth. Multitudes have rejected the possibility that such a thing as absolute truth could exist. “All is relative” has become the slogan of the post-modernist era of philosophy. We often hear phrases like “that may be true for you, but it’s not true for me.” Truth is seen as a personal preference or perception that cannot extend beyond a person’s individual boundaries. This viewpoint has a big bearing on the subject of ethics, which deals with the question of right and wrong behavior. If there is no such thing as absolute truth, then there is no ultimate moral rightness or wrongness about anything. Then, people are justified in saying, “It may be right for you but that does not mean it is right for me.”Such an idea is very appealing to many, but if taken to its logical extreme it proves absurd and disastrous. For example, what if it is right for someone to ignore traffic lights, even when they are red? That person will put the life of others at risk by doing what he believes is right. What if it is considered right by someone to go on a suicide-bombing mission in a heavily populated civilian area amongst people he sees as enemies? He may be fully convinced that what he is doing is correct. But does that make it right in any sense of the word? If there is no such thing as absolute truth, then no-one can really say “he should do that” or “she shouldn’t do that.” All one can say is, “A lot of people do not feel good about this action.” According to the relativist viewpoint, one might respond, “That may be true for you, but it is certainly not true for us.” These can be the ruinous ethical consequences of disregarding the belief of an Absolute Truth.Shree Krishna states that the demoniac nature is confused about what is right and what is wrong, and thus, neither purity, nor truth, nor right conduct is found in them. In the following verse, he goes on to describe the predominant views of such people.",dharma consists codes conduct conducive one purification general welfare living beings adharma consists prohibited actions lead degradation cause harm society the demoniac nature devoid faith knowledge wisdom scriptures hence sway confused right wrong actiona typical example present trend western philosophy having evolved various schools thought renaissance age enlightenment humanism empiricism communism existentialism skepticism present era western philosophy labeled postmodernism the prevalent view postmodernist thought absolute truth multitudes rejected possibility thing absolute truth could exist all relative become slogan postmodernist era philosophy we often hear phrases like may true not true me truth seen personal preference perception not extend beyond person individual boundaries this viewpoint big bearing subject ethics deals question right wrong behavior if thing absolute truth ultimate moral rightness wrongness anything then people justified saying it may right not mean right me such idea appealing many taken logical extreme proves absurd disastrous for example right someone ignore traffic lights even red that person put life others risk believes right what considered right someone go suicidebombing mission heavily populated civilian area amongst people sees enemies he may fully convinced correct but make right sense word if thing absolute truth noone really say that all one say a lot people not feel good action according relativist viewpoint one might respond that may true certainly not true us these ruinous ethical consequences disregarding belief absolute truthshree krishna states demoniac nature confused right wrong thus neither purity truth right conduct found in following verse goes describe predominant views people
16,8,असत्यमप्रतिष्ठं ते जगदाहुरनीश्वरम् | अपरस्परसम्भूतं किमन्यत्कामहैतुकम् ॥8॥,"They say that the world is unreal, it has no basis, it is without a God. It is born of mutual union brought about by passion! What other (cause can there be)?","There are two ways of refraining from immoral behavior. The first is to refrain from unrighteousness through the exercise of will-power. The second way is to abstain from sin due to fear of God. People who have the ability to abstain from sinning merely by will-power are very few. The majority of people desist from doing wrong due to the fear of punishment. For example, it is observed on highways that the moment a police car is spotted, people immediately slow down to the permissible speed limit, but when they perceive there is no danger of being caught, they do not hesitate in exceeding the speed limit. Thus, if we believe in God, out of fear of him we will refrain from immoral behavior. Instead, if we do not believe in God, all his laws will still be applicable to us, and we will suffer the consequences of wrong-behavior.Those with demoniac natures do not wish to accept this imposition of authority and regulation of behavior that is a necessary corollary of belief in God. Instead, they prefer to subscribe to the view that there is no God and the world has no basis for moral order. They propagate ideas such as the “Big Bang Theory,” which postulates that the world was created by an accidental explosion that took place at time zero of creation, and thus there is no God who sustains the world. Such theories permit them to engage in sensual gratification without scruples or fear of consequences.Amongst the various forms of sensual gratification, sexual indulgence is the most intense. This is because the material realm is like a distorted reflection of the spiritual realm. In the spiritual realm, divine love is the basis of the activities of the liberated souls and their interactions with God. In the material realm, its distorted reflection, lust, dominates the consciousness of materially conditioned souls, particularly those under the mode of passion. Thus, the demoniac-minded see engagement in lustful activities as the purpose of human life.",there two ways refraining immoral behavior the first refrain unrighteousness exercise willpower the second way abstain sin due fear god people ability abstain sinning merely willpower the majority people desist wrong due fear punishment for example observed highways moment police car spotted people immediately slow permissible speed limit perceive danger caught not hesitate exceeding speed limit thus believe god fear refrain immoral behavior instead not believe god laws still applicable us suffer consequences wrongbehaviorthose demoniac natures not wish accept imposition authority regulation behavior necessary corollary belief god instead prefer subscribe view god world basis moral order they propagate ideas big bang theory postulates world created accidental explosion took place time zero creation thus god sustains world such theories permit engage sensual gratification without scruples fear consequencesamongst various forms sensual gratification sexual indulgence intense this material realm like distorted reflection spiritual realm in spiritual realm divine love basis activities liberated souls interactions god in material realm distorted reflection lust dominates consciousness materially conditioned souls particularly mode passion thus demoniacminded see engagement lustful activities purpose human life

He said:yāvajjīveta sukaṁ jīvet, ṛiṇaṁ kṛitvā ghṛitaṁ pivetbhasmī bhūtasya dehasya punarāgamanaṁ kutaḥ [v2]“As long as you live, enjoy yourself. If drinking ghee gives you pleasure, then do so even if you have to take a debt for the purpose. When the body is cremated, you will cease to exist, and will not come back in the world again (so do not worry of any karmic consequences of your actions).”In this fashion, the demoniac-minded reject the eternality of the soul and the possibility of karmic reactions, so that they may engage in self-serving and even cruel deeds without any qualms. If they happen to possess power over other humans, they impose their misleading materialistic views upon them as well. They do not hesitate to aggressively pursue their self-centered goals, even if it results in grief to others and destruction to the world. In history, humankind has repeatedly witnessed megalomaniac dictators and emperors, such as Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, etc. who were motivated by their perverse views of the truth and brought about untold suffering and devastation to the world.",bereft true selfknowledge demoniacminded fabricate distorted views truth impure intellects an example theory charvak wellknown materialistic philosopher indian history he said yāvajjīveta sukaṁ jīvet ṛiṇaṁ kṛitvā ghṛitaṁ pivetbhasmī bhūtasya dehasya punarāgamanaṁ kutaḥ as long live enjoy if drinking ghee gives pleasure even take debt purpose when body cremated cease exist not come back world not worry karmic consequences actions in fashion demoniacminded reject eternality soul possibility karmic reactions may engage selfserving even cruel deeds without qualms if happen possess power humans impose misleading materialistic views upon well they not hesitate aggressively pursue selfcentered goals even results grief others destruction world in history humankind repeatedly witnessed megalomaniac dictators emperors hitler mussolini stalin etc motivated perverse views truth brought untold suffering devastation world

They prefer to pursue the way of the world that promises to provide immediate gratification, but they end up struggling even more in the worldly direction. Their desires for material attainments torment them and they undertake enormous schemes to fulfill their aspirations. When a cherished object is attained, for a moment they experience relief, but then new anguish begins. They are worried about the object being snatched away and they labor to retain it. Finally, when the inevitable separation from the object of attachment takes place, there is only misery.

If they show the same level of attachment and concern for developing love for Shree Krishna’s lotus feet, they will never again have to worry about Yamraj, the god of death (for they will cross over the cycle of life and death).” But the demoniac-minded refuse to accept this blatant fact because their intellects are convinced that worldly pleasures are the highest experience of joy.

That is why materialistic people who are driven by insatiable desires accord such priority to accumulating it in their lives. They do not even hesitate to adopt unlawful means for earning wealth. Therefore, double punishment awaits them for their unethical conduct. The Bhāgavatam states:yāvad bhriyeta jaṭharaṁ tāvat svatvaṁ hi dehināmadhikaṁ yo ’bhimanyeta sa steno daṇḍam arhati (7.14.8)[v4]“One is entitled to keep only as much wealth as is necessary for one’s maintenance (the rest must be given away in charity). If one accumulates more than one’s need, one is a thief in the eyes of God, and will be punished for it.” What is the punishment? Firstly, at the time of death, the wealth one earned will not go along—it will be snatched away. Secondly, according to the law of karma, one will be punished for the sins committed in earning the wealth.

Realizing that the ritualistic practices of the Vedas will help them become materially affluent, they even perform ritualistic ceremonies to accrue abundance and fame from them. However, like the vulture that flies high but keeps its sight fixed low, the demoniac sometimes rise in social status, but their actions remain mean and lowly. Such people respect power and believe in the principle of “might is right.” Hence, they do not hesitate in even harming or injuring others to eliminate obstacles in the fulfillment of their desires.

The second kind is common people who believe in engaging in the welfare of others, provided it does not harm them. The third kind is the demoniac who do not mind harming others, if it helps fulfill their self-interest. There is also a fourth kind of people who harm others, for no reason (except sadistic delight). There is no suitable name for them.” Shree Krishna vividly describes the degraded nature of the demoniac-mentality. Blinded by pride, they think along these lines: “I was born in a wealthy and aristocratic family. I am rich and powerful, and I do what I like. There is no need for me to bow down before God because I am like God myself.”In most cases, when people say “I,” it is their ego speaking, not them. The ego contains personal identifications with opinions, external appearances, resentments, etc. This ego builds a personality of its own, and under its sway, people identify with thoughts, emotions, and bundles of memories, which they see as integral parts of themselves. The ego identifies with owning, but the satisfaction of having is usually short-lived. Concealed within it is a deep-rooted dissatisfaction of “not enough.” This unfulfilled want results in unease, restlessness, boredom, anxiety, and dissatisfaction. Consequently, a much distorted perception of reality is created, which further alienates their perception of “I” from the real self.The ego creates the biggest untruth in our lives, and makes us believe what we are not.

I shall perform sacrifices; I shall give, I shall rejoice,'-thus they are diversely deluded by non-discrimination. Bewildered by numerous thoughts, caught in the net of delusion, (and) engrossed in the enjoyment of desirable objects, they fall into a foul hell.","Under the sway of the ego, people identify with their mind and become confined by its dysfunctional and repetitive thought patterns. They become practically possessed by their own mind, which goes on and on like a broken record, and they live in the reality their thoughts create for them. One such favorite thought pattern of the impure mind is complaining. It loves to whine and feel resentful not only about people but also about situations. The implication is, “This should not be happening,” “I do not want to be here,” “I am being treated unfairly,” etc. Every complaint is a little story that the mind makes up and the individual completely believes in it. The voice in the head tells sad, anxious, or angry stories about one’s life. And the poor individual, under the sway of the ego, accepts what the voice says. When complaining aggravates, it turns into resentment. Resentment means feeling bitter, indignant, aggrieved, or offended. When the resentment becomes longstanding, it is called a grievance. A grievance is a strong negative emotion connected to an event in the past that is being kept alive by compulsive thinking, by retelling the story in the head of “what someone did to me.” In this verse, Shree Krishna says that the demoniac who choose to live in the mesh of delusion created by the ego become bewildered by numerous thoughts of the poorest quality. Consequently, they obscure their own destiny.Humans are free to perform karmas by their choice, but they are not free to determine the results of their actions. The results are bestowed by God in accordance with the law of karma. The Ramayan states:karama pradhāna bisva kari rākhā, jo jasa karai so tasa phala chākhā [v9] “Actions are important in this world. Whatever actions people perform, they taste the corresponding fruits.” Hence, everyone has to face the karmic consequences of their actions. The Bible also states: “Be sure your sin will find you out.” (Numbers 32.23)[v9.1] Thus, in their next lives, God casts those who choose to cultivate demoniac qualities into inferior states of existence. The principle is very simple:ūrdhvaṁ gachchhanti sattvasthā madhye tiṣhṭhanti rājasāḥjaghanya guṇa vṛittisthā adho tiṣhṭhanti tāmasāḥ (Garuḍ Purāṇ)[v10]“Those who act out of sāttvic mentalities rise to the higher levels of existence; those who act out of rājasic mentalities remain in the middle regions; and those who act out of a tāmasic mentality and are inclined toward sin descend to the lower levels of existence.”",under sway ego people identify mind become confined dysfunctional repetitive thought patterns they become practically possessed mind goes like broken record live reality thoughts create one favorite thought pattern impure mind complaining it loves whine feel resentful not people also situations the implication this not happening i not want i treated unfairly etc every complaint little story mind makes individual completely believes the voice head tells sad anxious angry stories one life and poor individual sway ego accepts voice says when complaining aggravates turns resentment resentment means feeling bitter indignant aggrieved offended when resentment becomes longstanding called grievance a grievance strong negative emotion connected event past kept alive compulsive thinking retelling story head someone me in verse shree krishna says demoniac choose live mesh delusion created ego become bewildered numerous thoughts poorest quality consequently obscure destinyhumans free perform karmas choice not free determine results actions the results bestowed god accordance law karma the ramayan states karama pradhāna bisva kari rākhā jo jasa karai tasa phala chākhā actions important world whatever actions people perform taste corresponding fruits hence everyone face karmic consequences actions the bible also states be sure sin find out numbers thus next lives god casts choose cultivate demoniac qualities inferior states existence the principle simple ūrdhvaṁ gachchhanti sattvasthā madhye tiṣhṭhanti rājasāḥjaghanya guṇa vṛittisthā adho tiṣhṭhanti tāmasāḥ garuḍ purāṇ those act sāttvic mentalities rise higher levels existence act rājasic mentalities remain middle regions act tāmasic mentality inclined toward sin descend lower levels existence

Therefore, one should forsake these three.","Shree Krishna now describes the origin of the demoniac disposition, and pinpoints lust, anger, and greed as the three causes for it. Previously, in verse 3.36, Arjun had asked him why people are impelled to commit sin, even unwillingly, as if by force. Shree Krishna had answered that it is lust, which later transforms into anger, and is the all-devouring enemy of the world. Greed is also a transformation of lust, as explained in detail in the commentary of verse 2.62. Together, lust, anger, and greed are the foundations from which the demoniac vices develop.

But when materialistic yearnings diminish, the intellect, free from the material mode of passion, is able to perceive the shortsightedness of pursuing the path of preya. Then one gets drawn toward shreya, or happiness that is unpleasant in the present but becomes sweet in the end. And for those attracted to shreya, the path of enlightenment opens up.

They provide us with knowledge and understanding. They also give us instructions on what to do and what not to do. These instructions are of two kinds—vidhi and niṣhedh. The directives to perform certain activities are called vidhi. The directives not to perform certain activities are called niṣhedh. By faithfully following both these kinds of injunctions, human beings can proceed toward perfection. But the ways of the demoniac are the reverse of the teachings of the scriptures. They engage in prohibited acts and refrain from recommended ones. Referring to such people, Shree Krishna declares that those who renounce the authorized path and act according to their whims, impelled by the impulses of their desires, achieve neither true knowledge, nor the perfection of happiness, nor liberation from material bondage.",scriptures guide maps given humans journey toward enlightenment they provide us knowledge understanding they also give us instructions not these instructions two niṣhedh the directives perform certain activities called vidhi the directives not perform certain activities called niṣhedh by faithfully following kinds injunctions human beings proceed toward perfection but ways demoniac reverse teachings scriptures they engage prohibited acts refrain recommended ones referring people shree krishna declares renounce authorized path act according whims impelled impulses desires achieve neither true knowledge perfection happiness liberation material bondage

By comparing and differentiating between the divine and demoniac natures, he highlighted how the demoniac nature leads to hellish existence. Thus, he established that nothing is to be gained by discarding the injunctions of the scriptures. Now he drives home the point by stating that the absolute authority in ascertaining the propriety of any activity, or lack of it, are the Vedic scriptures.Sometimes, even well-intentioned people say, “I do not care for rules. I follow my heart and do my own thing.” It is all very well to follow the heart, but how can they be sure that their heart is not misleading them? As the saying goes, “The road to hell is paved with good intentions.” Thus, it is always wise to check with the scriptures whether our heart is truly guiding us in the proper direction. The Manu Smṛiti states:bhūtaṁ bhavyaṁ bhaviṣhyaṁ cha sarvaṁ vedāt prasidhyati (12.97)[v12]“The authenticity of any spiritual principle of the past, present, or future, must be established on the basis of the Vedas.” Hence, Shree Krishna concludes by instructing Arjun to comprehend the teachings of the scriptures and act according to them.",shree krishna gives final conclusion teachings chapter by comparing differentiating divine demoniac natures highlighted demoniac nature leads hellish existence thus established nothing gained discarding injunctions scriptures now drives home point stating absolute authority ascertaining propriety activity lack vedic scripturessometimes even wellintentioned people say i not care rules i follow heart thing it well follow heart sure heart not misleading as saying goes the road hell paved good intentions thus always wise check scriptures whether heart truly guiding us proper direction the manu smṛiti states bhūtaṁ bhavyaṁ bhaviṣhyaṁ cha sarvaṁ vedāt prasidhyati the authenticity spiritual principle past present future must established basis vedas hence shree krishna concludes instructing arjun comprehend teachings scriptures act according

At the end of the chapter, he stated that one who disregards the injunctions of the scriptures, and instead foolishly follows the impulses of the body and the whims of the mind, will not achieve perfection, happiness, or freedom from the cycle of life and death. He thus recommended that people follow the guidance of the scriptures and act accordingly. This instruction led to the present question. Arjun desires to know the nature of the faith of those who worship without reference to the Vedic scriptures.

17,2,श्रीभगवानुवाच | त्रिविधा भवति श्रद्धा देहिनां सा स्वभावजा | सात्विकी राजसी चैव तामसी चेति तां शृणु ॥2॥,"The Blessed Lord said: That faith of the embodied beings, born of their own nature, is threefold-born of sattva, rajas and tamas. Hear about it.","Nobody can be without faith, for it is an inseparable aspect of the human personality. Those who do not believe in the scriptures are also not bereft of faith. Their faith is reposed elsewhere. It could be on the logical ability of their intellect, or the perceptions of their senses, or the theories they have decided to believe in. For example, when people say, “I do not believe in God because I cannot see him,” they do not have faith in God but they have faith in their eyes. Hence, they assume that if their eyes cannot see something, it probably does not exist. This is also a kind of faith. Others say, “I do not believe in the authenticity of the ancient scriptures. Instead I accept the theories of modern science.” This is also a kind of faith, for we have seen in the last few centuries how theories of science keep getting amended and overthrown. It is possible that the present scientific theories we believe to be true may also be proved incorrect in the future. Accepting them as truths is also a leap of faith. Prof. Charles H. Townes, Nobel Prize winner in Physics, expressed this very nicely: “Science itself requires faith. We don’t know if our logic is correct. I don’t know if you are there. You don’t know if I am here. We may just be imagining all this. I have a faith that the world is what it seems like, and thus I believe you are there. I can’t prove it from any fundamental point of view… Yet I have to accept a certain framework in which to operate. The idea that ‘religion is faith’ and ‘science is knowledge,’ I think, is quite wrong. We scientists believe in the existence of the external world and the validity of our own logic. We feel quite comfortable about it. Nevertheless these are acts of faith. We can’t prove them.” Whether one is a material scientist, a social scientist, or a spiritual scientist, one cannot avoid the leap of faith required in the acceptance of knowledge. Shree Krishna now explains the reason why different people choose to place their faith in different places.",nobody without faith inseparable aspect human personality those not believe scriptures also not bereft faith their faith reposed elsewhere it could logical ability intellect perceptions senses theories decided believe for example people say i not believe god i not see not faith god faith eyes hence assume eyes not see something probably not exist this also kind faith others say i not believe authenticity ancient scriptures instead i accept theories modern science this also kind faith seen last centuries theories science keep getting amended overthrown it possible present scientific theories believe true may also proved incorrect future accepting truths also leap faith prof charles h townes nobel prize winner physics expressed nicely science requires faith we know logic correct i know you know i we may imagining i faith world seems like thus i believe i prove fundamental point yet i accept certain framework operate the idea religion faith science knowledge i think quite wrong we scientists believe existence external world validity logic we feel quite comfortable nevertheless acts faith we prove them whether one material scientist social scientist spiritual scientist one not avoid leap faith required acceptance knowledge shree krishna explains reason different people choose place faith different places

This person is made up of faith as the dominant factor. He is verily what his faith is.","In the previous verse, it was explained that we all repose our faith somewhere or the other. Where we decide to place our faith and what we choose to believe in practically shapes the direction of our life. Those who develop the conviction that money is of paramount importance in the world spend their entire life accumulating it. Those who believe that fame counts more than anything else dedicate their time and energy in chasing political posts and social designations. Those who believe in noble values sacrifice everything to uphold them. Mahatma Gandhi had faith in the incomparable importance of satya (truth) and ahinsā (non-violence), and by the strength of his convictions he launched a non-violent movement that succeeded in evicting from India the most powerful empire in the world. Those who develop deep faith in the overriding importance of God-realization renounce their material life in search of him. Thus, Shree Krishna states that the quality of our faith decides the direction of our life. In turn, the quality of our faith is decided by the nature of our mind. And so, in response to Arjun’s question, Shree Krishna begins expounding on the kinds of faith that exist.",in previous verse explained repose faith somewhere where decide place faith choose believe practically shapes direction life those develop conviction money paramount importance world spend entire life accumulating those believe fame counts anything else dedicate time energy chasing political posts social designations those believe noble values sacrifice everything uphold mahatma gandhi faith incomparable importance satya truth ahinsā nonviolence strength convictions launched nonviolent movement succeeded evicting india powerful empire world those develop deep faith overriding importance godrealization renounce material life search thus shree krishna states quality faith decides direction life in turn quality faith decided nature mind and response arjun question shree krishna begins expounding kinds faith exist

Foods in the mode of goodness have the same effect. In the above verse, these foods are described with the words āyuḥ sattva, meaning “which promote longevity.” They bestow good health, virtue, happiness, and satisfaction. Such foods are juicy, naturally tasteful, mild, and beneficial. These include grains, pulses, beans, fruits, vegetables, milk, and other vegetarian foods.Hence, a vegetarian diet is beneficial for cultivating the qualities of the mode of goodness that are conducive for spiritual life. Numerous sāttvic (influenced by the mode of goodness) thinkers and philosophers in history have echoed this sentiment:“Vegetarianism is a greater progress. From the greater clearness of head and quicker apprehension motivated him to become a vegetarian. Flesh-eating is an unprovoked murder.” Benjamin Franklin“Is it not a reproach that man is a carnivorous animal? True, he can and does live, in a great measure, by preying on other animals; but this is a miserable way. I have no doubt that it is a part of the destiny of the human race, in its gradual improvement, to leave off eating animals, as surely as the savage tribes have left off eating each other when they came in contact with the more civilized.” Henry David Thoreau in “Walden”“It is necessary to correct the error that vegetarianism has made us weak in mind, or passive or inert in action. I do not regard flesh-food as necessary at any stage.” Mahatma Gandhi.“O my fellow men, do not defile your bodies with sinful foods. We have corn and we have apples bending down the branches with their weight. There are vegetables that can be cooked and softened over the fire. The earth affords a lavish supply of riches, of innocent foods, and offers you banquets that involve no bloodshed or slaughter; only beasts satisfy their hunger with flesh, and not even all of those, because horses, cattle, and sheep live on grass.” Pythagoras“I do not want to make my stomach a graveyard of dead animals.” George Bernard ShawEven amongst violence against animals, killing of the cow is particularly heinous.

Foods that are impure, have bad taste, or possess foul smells come in the same category. Impure foods also include all kinds of meat products. Nature has designed the human body to be vegetarian. Human beings do not have long canine teeth as carnivorous animals do, or a wide jaw suitable for tearing flesh. Carnivores have short bowels to allow minimal transit time for the unstable and dead animal food, which putrefies and decays faster. On the contrary, humans have a longer digestive tract for the slow and better absorption of plant food. The stomach of carnivores is more acidic than human beings, which enables them to digest raw meat. Interestingly, the carnivorous animals do not sweat through their pores. Rather, they regulate body temperature through their tongue. On the other hand, herbivorous animals and humans control bodily temperature by sweating through their skin. While drinking, carnivores lap up water rather than suck it. In contrast, herbivores do not lap up water; they suck it. Humans too suck water while drinking; they do not lap it up. All these physical characteristics of the human body reveal that God has not created us as carnivorous creatures, and consequently, meat is considered impure food for humans.Meat-eating also creates bad karma. The Manu Smṛiti states:māṁ sa bhakṣhayitā 'mutra yasya māṁsam ihādmy ahametan māṁsasya māṁsatvaṁ pravadanti manīṣhiṇaḥ (5.55)[v2]“The word mānsa (meat) means “that whom I am eating here will eat me in my next life.” For this reason, the learned say that meat is called mānsa (a repeated act: I eat him, he eats me).”",cooked foods remained one yām three hours classified mode ignorance foods impure bad taste possess foul smells come category impure foods also include kinds meat products nature designed human body vegetarian human beings not long canine teeth carnivorous animals wide jaw suitable tearing flesh carnivores short bowels allow minimal transit time unstable dead animal food putrefies decays faster on contrary humans longer digestive tract slow better absorption plant food the stomach carnivores acidic human beings enables digest raw meat interestingly carnivorous animals not sweat pores rather regulate body temperature tongue on hand herbivorous animals humans control bodily temperature sweating skin while drinking carnivores lap water rather suck in contrast herbivores not lap water suck humans suck water drinking not lap all physical characteristics human body reveal god not created us carnivorous creatures consequently meat considered impure food humansmeateating also creates bad karma the manu smṛiti states māṁ sa bhakṣhayitā mutra yasya māṁsam ihādmy ahametan māṁsasya māṁsatvaṁ pravadanti manīṣhiṇaḥ the word mānsa meat means i eating eat next life for reason learned say meat called mānsa repeated act i eat eats

There are proper actions that are beneficial for society and for us. At the same time, there are inappropriate actions that are harmful for others and us. However, who is to decide what is beneficial and what is harmful? And in case a dispute arises, what is the basis for resolving it? If everyone makes their own decisions then pandemonium will prevail. So the injunctions of the scriptures serve as guide maps and wherever a doubt arises, we consult these scriptures for ascertaining the propriety of any action. However, those in the mode of ignorance do not have faith in the scriptures. They carry out religious ceremonies but disregard the ordinances of the scriptures.In India, specific gods and goddess associated with each festival are worshipped with great pomp and splendor. Often the motive behind the external grandeur of the ceremony—gaudy decorations, dazzling illumination, and blaring music—is to collect contributions from the neighborhood. Further, the Vedic injunction of offering a donation to the priests performing religious ceremony, as a mark of gratitude and respect, is not followed. Sacrifice in which such injunctions of the scriptures are ignored and a self-determined process is followed, due to laziness, indifference, or belligerence, is in the mode of ignorance. Such faith is actually a form of faithlessness in God and the scriptures.",at every moment life individuals choices regarding actions perform there proper actions beneficial society us at time inappropriate actions harmful others us however decide beneficial harmful and case dispute arises basis resolving if everyone makes decisions pandemonium prevail so injunctions scriptures serve guide maps wherever doubt arises consult scriptures ascertaining propriety action however mode ignorance not faith scriptures they carry religious ceremonies disregard ordinances scripturesin india specific gods goddess associated festival worshipped great pomp splendor often motive behind external grandeur decorations dazzling illumination blaring collect contributions neighborhood further vedic injunction offering donation priests performing religious ceremony mark gratitude respect not followed sacrifice injunctions scriptures ignored selfdetermined process followed due laziness indifference belligerence mode ignorance such faith actually form faithlessness god scriptures

In the process of purification, metals are heated and melted, so that the impurities may rise to the top and be removed. When gold is placed in the fire, its impurities get burnt and its luster increases. Similarly, the Vedas state: atapta tanurnatadā mośhnute (Rig Veda 9.83.1)[v3] “Without purifying the body through austerity, one cannot reach the final state of yog.” By sincerely practicing austerity, human beings can uplift and transform their lives from the mundane to the divine. Such austerity should be performed without show, with pure intent, in a peaceable manner, in conformance with the guidance of the spiritual master and the scriptures.Shree Krishna now classifies such austerity into three categories—of the body, speech, and mind. In this verse, he talks of the austerity of the body. When the body is dedicated to the service of the pure and saintly, and all sense indulgence in general, and sexual indulgence in particular, is eschewed, it is acclaimed as austerity of the body.

17,16,मन: प्रसाद: सौम्यत्वं मौनमात्मविनिग्रह: | भावसंशुद्धिरित्येतत्तपो मानसमुच्यते ॥16॥,"Tranquillity of mind, gentleness, reticence, withdrawal of the mind, purity of heart, -these are what is called mental austerity.","Austerity of the mind is higher than the austerity of body and speech, for if we learn to master the mind, the body and speech automatically get mastered, while the reverse is not necessarily true. Factually, the state of the mind determines the state of an individual’s consciousness. Shree Krishna had stated in verse 6.5, “Elevate yourself through the power of your mind and not degrade yourself, for the mind can be the friend and also the enemy of the self.”The mind may be likened to a garden, which can either be intelligently cultivated or allowed to run wild. Gardeners cultivate their plot, growing fruits, flowers, and vegetables in it. At the same time, they also ensure that it remains free from weeds. Similarly, we must cultivate our own mind with rich and noble thoughts, while weeding out the negative and debilitating thoughts. If we allow resentful, hateful, blaming, unforgiving, critical, and condemning thoughts to reside in our mind, they will have a debilitating effect on our personality. We can never get a fair amount of constructive action out of the mind until we have learned to control it and keep it from becoming stimulated by anger, hatred, dislike, etc. These are the weeds that choke out the manifestation of divine grace within our hearts.People imagine that their thoughts are secret and have no external consequences because they dwell within the mind, away from the sight of others. They do not realize that thoughts not only forge their inner character but also their external personality. That is why we look upon someone and say, “He seems like a very simple and trustworthy person.” For another person, we say, “She seems to be very cunning and deceitful. Stay away from her.” In each case, it was the thoughts people harbored that sculpted their appearance. Ralph Waldo Emerson said: “There is full confession in the glances of our eyes, in our smiles, in salutations, in the grasp of the hands. Our sin bedaubs us, mars all the good impressions. Men do not know why they do not trust us. The vice glasses the eyes, demeans the cheek, pinches the nose, and writes, ‘O fool, fool!’ on the forehead of a king.” Another powerful saying linking thoughts to character states:“Watch your thoughts, for they become words.Watch your words, for they become actions.Watch your actions, for they become habits.Watch your habits, for they become character.Watch your character, for it becomes your destiny.”It is important to realize that we harm ourselves with every negative thought that we harbor in our mind. At the same time, we uplift ourselves with every positive thought that we dwell upon. Henry Van Dyke expressed this very vividly, in his poem “Thoughts are things.”I hold it true that thoughts are things;They’re endowed with bodies and breath and wingsThat which we call our secret thoughtSpeeds forth to earth’s remotest spot,Leaving its blessings or its woes,Like tracks behind as it goes.We build our future, thought by thought.For good or ill, yet know it not,Choose, then, thy destiny and wait,For love brings love, and hate brings hate.Each thought we dwell upon has consequences, and thought-by-thought, we forge our destiny. For this reason, to veer the mind from negative emotions and make it dwell upon the positive sentiments is considered austerity of the mind.",austerity mind higher austerity body speech learn master mind body speech automatically get mastered reverse not necessarily true factually state mind determines state individual consciousness shree krishna stated verse elevate power mind not degrade mind friend also enemy self the mind may likened garden either intelligently cultivated allowed run wild gardeners cultivate plot growing fruits flowers vegetables at time also ensure remains free weeds similarly must cultivate mind rich noble thoughts weeding negative debilitating thoughts if allow resentful hateful blaming unforgiving critical condemning thoughts reside mind debilitating effect personality we never get fair amount constructive action mind learned control keep becoming stimulated anger hatred dislike etc these weeds choke manifestation divine grace within heartspeople imagine thoughts secret external consequences dwell within mind away sight others they not realize thoughts not forge inner character also external personality that look upon someone say he seems like simple trustworthy person for another person say she seems cunning deceitful stay away her in case thoughts people harbored sculpted appearance ralph waldo emerson said there full confession glances eyes smiles salutations grasp hands our sin bedaubs us mars good impressions men not know not trust us the vice glasses eyes demeans cheek pinches nose writes o fool fool forehead king another powerful saying linking thoughts character states watch thoughts become wordswatch words become actionswatch actions become habitswatch habits become characterwatch character becomes destiny it important realize harm every negative thought harbor mind at time uplift every positive thought dwell upon henry van dyke expressed vividly poem thoughts things i hold true thoughts things they endowed bodies breath wingsthat call secret thoughtspeeds forth earth remotest spot leaving blessings woes like tracks behind goeswe build future thought thoughtfor good ill yet know not choose thy destiny wait for love brings love hate brings hateeach thought dwell upon consequences thoughtbythought forge destiny for reason veer mind negative emotions make dwell upon positive sentiments considered austerity mind

It is an act of duty to give according to one’s capacity.

It reduces the attachment of the giver toward material objects; it develops the attitude of service; it expands the heart, and fosters the sentiment of compassion for others. Hence, most religious traditions follow the injunction of giving away one-tenth of one’s earnings in charity. The Skandh Purāṇ states:nyāyopārjita vittasya daśhamānśhena dhīmataḥkartavyo viniyogaśhcha īśhvaraprityarthameva cha [v7]“From the wealth you have earned by rightful means, take out one-tenth, and as a matter of duty, give it away in charity. Dedicate your charity for the pleasure of God.” Charity is classified as proper or improper, superior or inferior, according to the factors mentioned by Shree Krishna in this verse.

Doubt is also like an untamed horse that runs wild in the mind and destroys the garden of devotion. Arjun indicates, “Just as you slayed the Keshi demon, please slay the demon of doubt in my mind.” His question is penetrating and poignant. He wishes to know the nature of sanyās, which means “renunciation of actions.” He also wishes to know the nature of tyāg, which means “renunciation of desires for enjoying the fruits of actions.” Further, he uses the word pṛithak, meaning difference; he wishes to understand the distinction between the two terms. Arjun also refers to Shree Krishna as Hrishikesh, meaning “master of the senses.” Arjun’s goal is to accomplish the greatest of conquests, which is to subdue the mind and the senses. It is this conquest that can bestow the state of perfect peace. And the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna, as the Master of the senses, himself embodies this state of perfection.This topic had been explained in the previous chapters as well. Shree Krishna had talked about sanyās in verses 5.13 and 9.28, and about tyāg in verses 4.20 and 12.11, but he explains it here from another angle. The same truth permits itself to be presented from a variety of perspectives and each perspective provides its own unique appeal. For example, various sections of a garden leave differing impressions on the viewer’s mind, while the entire garden creates yet another impression. The Bhagavad Gita is very much like this. Each chapter is designated as a particular Yog, while the eighteenth chapter is considered the synopsis. In this chapter, Shree Krishna briefly summarizes the perennial principles and eternal truths that were presented in the previous seventeen chapters and establishes the collective conclusion of all of them. After discussing the topics of renunciation and detachment, he goes on to explain the natures of the three guṇas and how they affect people’s natural propensities for work. He reiterates that the mode of goodness is the only mode worthy of cultivation. He then concludes that bhakti, or exclusive loving devotion to the Supreme Lord is the paramount duty, and its attainment is the goal of human life.",arjun addresses shree krishna keshinisudan meaning killer keshi demon in divine pastimes earth lord krishna killed furious violent demon called keshi taken form mad horse created havoc land braj doubt also like untamed horse runs wild mind destroys garden devotion arjun indicates just slayed keshi demon please slay demon doubt mind his question penetrating poignant he wishes know nature sanyās means renunciation actions he also wishes know nature tyāg means renunciation desires enjoying fruits actions further uses word pṛithak meaning difference wishes understand distinction two terms arjun also refers shree krishna hrishikesh meaning master senses arjun goal accomplish greatest conquests subdue mind senses it conquest bestow state perfect peace and supreme lord shree krishna master senses embodies state perfectionthis topic explained previous chapters well shree krishna talked sanyās verses tyāg verses explains another angle the truth permits presented variety perspectives perspective provides unique appeal for example various sections garden leave differing impressions viewer mind entire garden creates yet another impression the bhagavad gita much like each chapter designated particular yog eighteenth chapter considered synopsis in chapter shree krishna briefly summarizes perennial principles eternal truths presented previous seventeen chapters establishes collective conclusion after discussing topics renunciation detachment goes explain natures three guṇas affect people natural propensities work he reiterates mode goodness mode worthy cultivation he concludes bhakti exclusive loving devotion supreme lord paramount duty attainment goal human life

The adepts call the abandonment of the results of all works as tyaga.,"Kavayaḥ are the learned. Shree Krishna states that learned people consider sanyās as the renunciation of works. Those who renounce works for material enjoyment and enter the renounced order are called karm sanyāsīs. They continue to do some of the nitya karm (daily works for the maintenance of the body), but they renounce kāmya karm (works related to acquisition of wealth, progeny, prestige, status, power, etc). Such works bind the soul further in the wheel of karma and lead to repeated rebirths in the samsara of birth and death.Vichakṣhaṇāḥ are the wise. Shree Krishna states that wise people lay emphasis on tyāg, meaning “internal renunciation.” This implies not relinquishing the prescribed Vedic duties, rather renouncing the desires for enjoying their fruits. Therefore, the attitude of giving up attachment to the rewards of actions is tyāg, while the attitude of giving up works is sanyas. Both sanyās and tyāg seem plausible and reasonable options to pursue for enlightenment. Of these two courses of action, which one does Shree Krishna recommend?

They opine that all actions should be abandoned because they are motivated by desire, which promotes further transmigration in the cycle of life and death. They contend that all works are subject to inherent defects, such as indirect violence. For example, if one lights a fire, there is always the possibility of insects getting involuntarily burnt in it. Hence, they recommend the path of cessation of all actions, except those for the sustenance of the body.Other learned philosophers, such as those of the Mīmānsā school of thought, declare that prescribed Vedic activities should never be given up. They contend that wherever there are two contradictory injunctions of the Vedas, if a specific one is more prominent, it annuls the general one. For example, the Vedas instruct us: mā hinsyāt sarvā bhūtāni [v1] “Do not commit violence toward any living entity.” This is a general instruction. The same Vedas also instruct us to perform fire sacrifice. This is a specific instruction. It is possible that in performing a fire sacrifice some creatures may get killed in the fire unintentionally. But the Mīmānsakas (followers of the Mīmānsā philosophy) contend that the specific instruction for performing the sacrifice prevails, and it must be followed even though it conflicts with the general instruction for not committing violence. Therefore, the Mimānsakas say we must never give up beneficial activities, such as sacrifice, charity, and penance.",some philosophers sānkhya school thought favor liquidating mundane life quickly possible they opine actions abandoned motivated desire promotes transmigration cycle life death they contend works subject inherent defects indirect violence for example one lights fire always possibility insects getting involuntarily burnt hence recommend path cessation actions except sustenance bodyother learned philosophers mīmānsā school thought declare prescribed vedic activities never given they contend wherever two contradictory injunctions vedas specific one prominent annuls general one for example vedas instruct us mā hinsyāt sarvā bhūtāni do not commit violence toward living entity this general instruction the vedas also instruct us perform fire sacrifice this specific instruction it possible performing fire sacrifice creatures may get killed fire unintentionally but mīmānsakas followers mīmānsā philosophy contend specific instruction performing sacrifice prevails must followed even though conflicts general instruction not committing violence therefore mimānsakas say must never give beneficial activities sacrifice charity penance

For, O greatest among men, tyaga has been clearly declared to be of three kinds.","Renunciation is important because it is the basis for higher life. It is only by giving up the lower desires that we can cultivate the higher aspirations. Likewise, it is by giving up lower actions that we can dedicate ourselves to higher duties and activities, and walk the path of enlightenment. However in the previous verse, Shree Krishna revealed that there are differing views on the true understanding of what renunciation actually entails. Having mentioned the two primary opposing views in the previous verse, Shree Krishna now reveals his opinion, which is the final verdict on the subject. He says that he will expound upon the subject by dividing renunciation into three categories (described in verses 7 to 9). He addresses Arjun as vyāghra, meaning “tiger amongst men” because renunciation is for the brave-hearted. Saint Kabir said:tīra talavār se jo laṛai, so śhūravīra nahīṅ hoyamāyā taji bhakti kare, śhūra kahāvai soya [v2]“One is not brave by virtue of fighting with arrows and swords; that person is truly brave who renounces Maya and engages in bhakti.”",renunciation important basis higher life it giving lower desires cultivate higher aspirations likewise giving lower actions dedicate higher duties activities walk path enlightenment however previous verse shree krishna revealed differing views true understanding renunciation actually entails having mentioned two primary opposing views previous verse shree krishna reveals opinion final verdict subject he says expound upon subject dividing renunciation three categories described verses he addresses arjun vyāghra meaning tiger amongst men renunciation bravehearted saint kabir said tīra talavār se jo laṛai śhūravīra nahīṅ hoyamāyā taji bhakti kare śhūra kahāvai soya one not brave virtue fighting arrows swords person truly brave renounces maya engages bhakti
18,5,यज्ञदानतप:कर्म न त्याज्यं कार्यमेव तत् | यज्ञो दानं तपश्चैव पावनानि मनीषिणाम् ॥5॥,"The practice of sacrifice, charity and austerity is not to be abandoned; it is surely to be undertaken. Sacrifice, charity and austerity are verily the purifiers of the wise.","Here, Shree Krishna pronounces his verdict that we should never renounce actions which elevate us and are beneficial for humankind. Such actions, if performed in the proper consciousness, do not bind us, instead they help us grow spiritually. Consider, for example, a caterpillar. In order to transform itself, it weaves a cocoon for its evolution and encages itself in it. Once it becomes a butterfly, it breaks open the cocoon and soars into the sky. Our position in the world is similar to this. Like the ugly caterpillar, we are presently attached to the world and bereft of noble qualities. As a part of our self-preparation and self-education, we need to perform actions that bring about the inner transformation we desire. Yajña (sacrifice), dān (charity), and tapa (penance) are acts that help in our spiritual evolution and growth. At times, it may seem that they are binding too, but they are like the caterpillar’s cocoon. They melt our impurities, beautify us from within, and effectually help us break through the shackles of earthly life. Hence, Shree Krishna instructs in this verse that such auspicious activities must never be abandoned. He now qualifies his statement by revealing the proper attitude with which they must be performed.",here shree krishna pronounces verdict never renounce actions elevate us beneficial humankind such actions performed proper consciousness not bind us instead help us grow spiritually consider example caterpillar in order transform weaves cocoon evolution encages once becomes butterfly breaks open cocoon soars sky our position world similar like ugly caterpillar presently attached world bereft noble qualities as part selfpreparation selfeducation need perform actions bring inner transformation desire yajña sacrifice dān charity tapa penance acts help spiritual evolution growth at times may seem binding like caterpillar cocoon they melt impurities beautify us within effectually help us break shackles earthly life hence shree krishna instructs verse auspicious activities must never abandoned he qualifies statement revealing proper attitude must performed
18,6,एतान्यपि तु कर्माणि सङ्गं त्यक्त्वा फलानि च | कर्तव्यानीति मे पार्थ निश्चितं मतमुत्तमम् ॥6॥,"But even these actions have to be undertaken by renouncing attachment and (hankering for) results. This is My firm and best conclusion, O Partha.","Acts of sacrifice, charity, and penance should be done in the mood of devotion to the Supreme Lord. If that consciousness has not been attained, then they should verily be performed as a matter of duty, without desire for reward. A mother abandons her selfish joys to perform her duty to her offspring. She offers the milk in her breast to her baby and nourishes the baby. She does not lose by giving to the child, rather she fulfills her motherhood. Similarly, a cow grazes grass in the meadow all day long, but yields the milk in her udder to her calf. The cow does not become any less by performing its duty; on the other hand, people hold it in greater respect. Because these activities are performed selflessly, they are viewed as sacred. Shree Krishna states in this verse that the wise should perform auspicious and beneficial acts in the same attitude of selflessness. He now explains the three kinds of renunciation in the following three verses.",acts sacrifice charity penance done mood devotion supreme lord if consciousness not attained verily performed matter duty without desire reward a mother abandons selfish joys perform duty offspring she offers milk breast baby nourishes baby she not lose giving child rather fulfills motherhood similarly cow grazes grass meadow day long yields milk udder calf the cow not become less performing duty hand people hold greater respect because activities performed selflessly viewed sacred shree krishna states verse wise perform auspicious beneficial acts attitude selflessness he explains three kinds renunciation following three verses

Giving up that through delusion is declared to be based on tamas.,"Renouncing prohibited actions and unrighteous actions is proper; renouncing desire for the rewards of actions is also proper; but renouncing prescribed duties is never proper. Prescribed duties help purify the mind and elevate it from tamo guṇa to rajo guṇa to sattva guṇa. Abandoning them is an erroneous display of foolishness. Shree Krishna states that giving up prescribed duties in the name of renunciation is said to be in the mode of ignorance.Having come in this world, we all have obligatory duties. Fulfilling them helps develop many qualities in an individual, such as responsibility, discipline of the mind and senses, tolerance of pain and hardships, etc. Abandoning them, out of ignorance, leads to the degradation of the soul. These obligatory duties vary according to one’s level of consciousness. For an ordinary person, acts such as earning wealth, taking care of the family, bathing, eating, etc. are prescribed duties. As one gets elevated, these obligatory duties change. For an elevated soul, sacrifice, charity, and penance are the duties.",renouncing prohibited actions unrighteous actions proper renouncing desire rewards actions also proper renouncing prescribed duties never proper prescribed duties help purify mind elevate tamo guṇa rajo guṇa sattva guṇa abandoning erroneous display foolishness shree krishna states giving prescribed duties name renunciation said mode ignorancehaving come world obligatory duties fulfilling helps develop many qualities individual responsibility discipline mind senses tolerance pain hardships etc abandoning ignorance leads degradation soul these obligatory duties vary according one level consciousness for ordinary person acts earning wealth taking care family bathing eating etc prescribed duties as one gets elevated obligatory duties change for elevated soul sacrifice charity penance duties
18,8,दु:खमित्येव यत्कर्म कायक्लेशभयात्यजेत् | स कृत्वा राजसं त्यागं नैव त्यागफलं लभेत् ॥8॥,"Whatever action one may relinquish merely as being painful, from fear of physical suffering, he, having resorted to renunciation based on rajas, will surely not acquire the fruits of renunciation.","To advance in life does not mean abandoning our responsibilities, instead it entails increasing them. Novice spiritualists often do not understand this truth. Wishing to avoid pain and taking an escapist attitude, they make spiritual aspiration a pretext for relinquishing their obligatory duties. However, life is never meant to be without burdens. Advanced sādhaks are not those who are undisturbed because they do nothing, on the contrary, they retain their peace despite upholding a huge burden placed upon their shoulders. Shree Krishna declares in this verse that giving up duties because they are troublesome is renunciation in the mode of passion.From the beginning, the Bhagavad Gita is a call for action. Arjun finds his duty unpleasant and bothersome and, as a result, wishes to run away from the battlefield. Shree Krishna calls this ignorance and weakness. He encourages Arjun to continue doing his duty, even though it may be unpleasant, while simultaneously bringing about an internal transformation within him. For this purpose, he enlightens Arjun with spiritual knowledge and helps him develop the eyes of wisdom. Having heard the Bhagavad Gita, Arjun does not change his profession, but changes the consciousness he brings to bear upon his activities. Previously, the motive behind his work was to secure the kingdom of Hastinapur for his comfort and glory. Later, he continues to do his work, but as an act of devotion to God.",to advance life not mean abandoning responsibilities instead entails increasing novice spiritualists often not understand truth wishing avoid pain taking escapist attitude make spiritual aspiration pretext relinquishing obligatory duties however life never meant without burdens advanced sādhaks not undisturbed nothing contrary retain peace despite upholding huge burden placed upon shoulders shree krishna declares verse giving duties troublesome renunciation mode passionfrom beginning bhagavad gita call action arjun finds duty unpleasant bothersome result wishes run away battlefield shree krishna calls ignorance weakness he encourages arjun continue duty even though may unpleasant simultaneously bringing internal transformation within for purpose enlightens arjun spiritual knowledge helps develop eyes wisdom having heard bhagavad gita arjun not change profession changes consciousness brings bear upon activities previously motive behind work secure kingdom hastinapur comfort glory later continues work act devotion god
18,9,कार्यमित्येव यत्कर्म नियतं क्रियतेऽर्जुन | सङ्गं त्यक्त्वा फलं चैव स त्याग: सात्विको मत: ॥9॥,"Whatever obligatory duty is performed just because it is a bounden duty, O Arjuna, by giving up attachment and the result as well, -that renunciation is considered to be based on sattva.","Shree Krishna now describes the superior kind of renunciation, where we continue to perform our obligatory duties, but give up attachment to the fruit of actions. He describes this as the highest kind of renunciation, which is situated in the mode of goodness (sāttvic).Renunciation is definitely necessary for spiritual attainment. But the problem is that people’s understanding of renunciation is very shallow and they consider it to be only the external abandonment of works. Such renunciation leads to hypocrisy in which, while externally donning the robes of a renunciant, one internally contemplates upon the objects of the senses. There are many sadhus in India who come in this category. They left the world with the noble intention of God-realization, but because the mind was not yet detached from the objects of their senses, their renunciation did not bestow the desired fruits. Consequently, they found their actions did not lead them to a higher spiritual life at all. The defect was in their sequence—they strove first for external renunciation and later for internal detachment. The instruction of this verse is to reverse the sequence—first develop internal detachment and then renounce externally.",shree krishna describes superior kind renunciation continue perform obligatory duties give attachment fruit actions he describes highest kind renunciation situated mode goodness sāttvic renunciation definitely necessary spiritual attainment but problem people understanding renunciation shallow consider external abandonment works such renunciation leads hypocrisy externally donning robes renunciant one internally contemplates upon objects senses there many sadhus india come category they left world noble intention godrealization mind not yet detached objects senses renunciation not bestow desired fruits consequently found actions not lead higher spiritual life the defect strove first external renunciation later internal detachment the instruction verse reverse develop internal detachment renounce externally
18,10,न द्वेष्ट्यकुशलं कर्म कुशले नानुषज्जते | त्यागी सत्वसमाविष्टो मेधावी छिन्नसंशय: ॥10॥,"The man of renunciation who has become imbued with sattva, who is wise and freed from doubts, does not hate unbefitting action, nor does he become attached to befitting activity.","People who are situated in sāttvic renunciation are not miserable in disagreeable circumstances; nor do they get attached to situations that are agreeable to them. They simply do their duty under all conditions, without feeling elated when the going is good or feeling dejected when life becomes tough. They are not like a dry leaf that is tossed hither and tither by every passing breeze. Instead, they are like the reeds in the sea, gently negotiating every rising and falling wave. While retaining their equanimity and without succumbing to anger, greed, envy, or attachment, they watch the waves of events rising and falling around them. Bal Gangadhar Tilak was a scholar of the Bhagavad Gita and a famous karm yogi. Before Mahatma Gandhi came on the scene, he was at the forefront of the freedom struggle of India. He was asked what position he would choose if India became independent—Prime Minister or Foreign Minister? He replied, “My ambition was to write a book on Differential Calculus. I will fulfill it.” Once, the police arrested him for creating unrest. He asked his friend to find out the provisions under which he was arrested, and to inform him in prison. When the friend reached him after an hour, he was fast asleep in the jail. Another time, he was working in his office, and his clerk brought him the news that his elder son was seriously ill. Instead of getting emotionally wrought, he asked the clerk to get a doctor, and he continued working. Half an hour later, his friend came and conveyed the same news. He said, “I have called for the doctor to see him. What else can I do?” These instances reveal how he retained his composure despite being in the midst of tumultuous situations. He was able to continue performing his actions because of the internal emotional composure; had he been emotionally distressed he would have been unable to sleep in the jail cell or concentrate on his work at the office.",people situated sāttvic renunciation not miserable disagreeable circumstances get attached situations agreeable they simply duty conditions without feeling elated going good feeling dejected life becomes tough they not like dry leaf tossed hither tither every passing breeze instead like reeds sea gently negotiating every rising falling wave while retaining equanimity without succumbing anger greed envy attachment watch waves events rising falling around bal gangadhar tilak scholar bhagavad gita famous karm yogi before mahatma gandhi came scene forefront freedom struggle india he asked position would choose india became minister foreign minister he replied my ambition write book differential calculus i fulfill it once police arrested creating unrest he asked friend find provisions arrested inform prison when friend reached hour fast asleep jail another time working office clerk brought news elder son seriously ill instead getting emotionally wrought asked clerk get doctor continued working half hour later friend came conveyed news he said i called doctor see what else i these instances reveal retained composure despite midst tumultuous situations he able continue performing actions internal emotional composure emotionally distressed would unable sleep jail cell concentrate work office
18,11,न हि देहभृता शक्यं त्यक्तुं कर्माण्यशेषत: | यस्तु कर्मफलत्यागी स त्यागीत्यभिधीयते ॥11॥,"Since it is not possible for one who holds on to a body to give up actions entirely, therefore he, on the other hand, who renounces results on actions is called a man of renunciation.","It may be contended that better than renunciation of the fruits of actions is to simply renounce all actions, for then there will be no distraction from meditation and contemplation. Shree Krishna rejects this as a possible option by stating that the state of complete inactivity is impossible for the embodied being. The basic functions for the maintenance of the body, such as, eating, sleeping, bathing, etc. have to be performed by everyone. Besides, standing, sitting, thinking, walking, talking, etc. are also activities that cannot be avoided. If we understand renunciation to be the external abandonment of works, then no one can ever be truly renounced. However, Shree Krishna states here that if one can give up attachment to the fruits of actions, it is considered perfect renunciation.",it may contended better renunciation fruits actions simply renounce actions distraction meditation contemplation shree krishna rejects possible option stating state complete inactivity impossible embodied the basic functions maintenance body eating sleeping bathing etc performed everyone besides standing sitting thinking walking talking etc also activities not avoided if understand renunciation external abandonment works one ever truly renounced however shree krishna states one give attachment fruits actions considered perfect renunciation
18,12,अनिष्टमिष्टं मिश्रं च त्रिविधं कर्मण: फलम् | भवत्यत्यागिनां प्रेत्य न तु सन्न्यासिनां €क्वचित् ॥12॥,"The threefold results of actions-the undesirable, the desirable, and the mixed-accrues after death to those who do not resort to renunciation, but never to those who resort to monasticism.","The three kinds of rewards that the soul reaps after death are: 1) iṣhṭam, or pleasant experiences in the celestial abodes, 2) aniṣhṭam, or unpleasant experiences in the hellish abodes, and 3) miśhram, or mixed experiences in the human form on the earth planet. Those who perform virtuous actions are awarded the celestial realms; those who perform unrighteous actions are given birth in the nether realms; and those who perform a mixture of both come back to the human realm. But this applies only when the actions are performed with a desire for rewards. When such fruitive desire is renounced and work is done merely as a duty to God, then no such results accrue from actions.A similar rule exists in the world as well. If one person kills another it is considered murder, which is a crime that can even result in the death sentence. However, if the government declares that someone is a notorious murderer or thief who is wanted dead or alive, then killing such a person is not considered an offence in the eyes of the law. Instead, it is rewarded by the government, and the killer is even respected as a national hero. Similarly, when we give up personal motive in our actions, then the three-fold fruits of actions do not accrue.",the three kinds rewards soul reaps death iṣhṭam pleasant experiences celestial abodes aniṣhṭam unpleasant experiences hellish abodes miśhram mixed experiences human form earth planet those perform virtuous actions awarded celestial realms perform unrighteous actions given birth nether realms perform mixture come back human realm but applies actions performed desire rewards when fruitive desire renounced work done merely duty god results accrue actionsa similar rule exists world well if one person kills another considered murder crime even result death sentence however government declares someone notorious murderer thief wanted dead alive killing person not considered offence eyes law instead rewarded government killer even respected national hero similarly give personal motive actions threefold fruits actions not accrue

Simultaneously, he clarifies that the description of the five limbs of action is not a new analysis, but what has previously been described in the Sānkhya philosophy as well. Sānkhya refers to the system of philosophy established by Maharishi Kapil, who was a descension of God and appeared on the earth as the child of Kardam Muni and Devahuti. The Sānkhya philosophy he propounded is based upon a system of analytical rationality. It develops knowledge of the self through an analysis of the elements within the body and in the world. It also ascertains the nature of cause and effect by an analysis of the elements of action.",on knowing work performed without attachment fruits natural question arises what constitutes action shree krishna announces arjun going address question knowledge help develop detachment results actions simultaneously clarifies description five limbs action not new analysis previously described sānkhya philosophy well sānkhya refers system philosophy established maharishi kapil descension god appeared earth child kardam muni devahuti the sānkhya philosophy propounded based upon system analytical rationality it develops knowledge self analysis elements within body world it also ascertains nature cause effect analysis elements action
18,14,अधिष्ठानं तथा कर्ता करणं च पृथग्विधम् | विविधाश्च पृथक्चेष्टा दैवं चैवात्र पञ्चमम् ॥14॥,"The locus as also the agent, the different kinds of organs, the many and distinct activities, and, the divine is here the fifth.","In this verse, adhiṣhṭhānam means “place of residence,” and refers to the body, since karmas can only be performed when the soul is situated in the body. Kartā means “the doer,” and refers to the soul. Although the soul itself does not perform actions, it inspires the body-mind-intellect mechanism with the life force to act. Further, it identifies with their actions, due to the influence of the ego. Therefore, it is responsible for the actions performed by the body, and it is called both the knower and the doer. The Praśhna Upaniṣhad states: eṣha hi draṣhṭā spraṣhṭā śhrotā ghrātā rasayitā mantā boddhā kartā vijñānātmā puruṣhaḥ sa pare ’kṣhara ātmani saṁpratiṣhṭhate (4.9)[v3] “It is the soul that sees, touches, hears, feels, tastes, thinks, and comprehends. Thus, the soul is to be considered both—the knower and the doer of actions.” The Brahma Sūtra also states: jño ‘ta eva (2.3.18)[v4] “It is truly the soul that is the knower.” Again, the Brahma Sūtra states: kartā śhāstrārthavattvāt (2.3.33)[v5] “The soul is the doer of actions, and this is confirmed by the scriptures.” From the above quotations, it is clear that the soul is also a factor in accomplishing actions.The senses are instruments used for performing actions. Without the senses, the soul could not have experienced the sensations of taste, touch, sight, smell, or sound. There are also the five working senses—hands, legs, voice, genitals, and anus. It is with their help that the soul accomplishes various kinds of work. Thus, the senses are also listed as factors in accomplishing actions.Despite all the instruments of action, if one does not put in effort, nothing is ever done. In fact, effort is so important that Chanakya Pandit states in his Neeti Sūtras: utsāhavatāṁ śhatravopi vaśhībhavanti [v6] “With sufficient effort, even poor destiny can be transformed into good fortune.” Nirutvāhād daivaṁ patita [v7] “Without proper effort, even good destiny can be converted into misfortune.” Therefore, cheṣhṭhā (effort) is another ingredient of action.God is seated within the body of the living being as the witness. Based upon their past karmas, he also bestows different abilities to different people to perform actions. One may call this Divine Providence. For example, some people possess the acumen for earning huge amounts of wealth. Their acquaintances become astonished by their brilliant financial analysis of complex situations. They also seem to be lucky with the risks they take. This special intellect is granted to them by God. Similarly, others seem to have God-given talents in fields such as sports, music, art, literature, etc. It is God who bestows people these special abilities, in accordance with their past karmas. He also grants the results of the present karmas. Hence, he is listed as one of the factors responsible for action.",in verse adhiṣhṭhānam means place residence refers body since karmas performed soul situated body kartā means doer refers soul although soul not perform actions inspires bodymindintellect mechanism life force act further identifies actions due influence ego therefore responsible actions performed body called knower doer the praśhna upaniṣhad states eṣha hi draṣhṭā spraṣhṭā śhrotā ghrātā rasayitā mantā boddhā kartā vijñānātmā puruṣhaḥ sa pare kṣhara ātmani saṁpratiṣhṭhate it soul sees touches hears feels tastes thinks comprehends thus soul considered knower doer actions the brahma sūtra also states jño ta eva it truly soul knower again brahma sūtra states kartā śhāstrārthavattvāt the soul doer actions confirmed scriptures from quotations clear soul also factor accomplishing actionsthe senses instruments used performing actions without senses soul could not experienced sensations taste touch sight smell sound there also five working legs voice genitals anus it help soul accomplishes various kinds work thus senses also listed factors accomplishing actionsdespite instruments action one not put effort nothing ever done in fact effort important chanakya pandit states neeti sūtras utsāhavatāṁ śhatravopi vaśhībhavanti with sufficient effort even poor destiny transformed good fortune nirutvāhād daivaṁ patita without proper effort even good destiny converted misfortune therefore cheṣhṭhā effort another ingredient actiongod seated within body living witness based upon past karmas also bestows different abilities different people perform actions one may call divine providence for example people possess acumen earning huge amounts wealth their acquaintances become astonished brilliant financial analysis complex situations they also seem lucky risks take this special intellect granted god similarly others seem godgiven talents fields sports music art literature etc it god bestows people special abilities accordance past karmas he also grants results present karmas hence listed one factors responsible action

In each of these categories, whether we do virtuous or sinful acts, the five causes mentioned in the previous verse are responsible. Due to the ego, we think of ourselves as the doers of our actions. “I achieved this.” “I accomplished that.” “I will do this.” These are statements we make under the illusion of being the doer. Shree Krishna’s purpose in revealing this knowledge is to annihilate the soul’s pride of doership. Thus, he states that those who see the soul only as the contributory factor for action do not see things as they truly are. If the soul were not granted a body by God, it could not have done anything at all. Further, if the body were not energized by God, it could have still done nothing. The Kenopaniṣhad states:yadvāchānabhyuditaṁ yena vāgabhyudyate (1.4)[v8]“Brahman cannot be described by the voice.

It is like the driver in the car, who controls the steering wheel of the car and decides where to turn it and at what speed to drive. Similarly, the soul too governs the actions of the body, mind, and intellect, but it should not claim credit for any action(s) for itself. If we see ourselves to be the sole cause of action, then we want to be the enjoyers of our actions as well. But when we free ourselves from the pride of doership and ascribe the credit of our efforts to the grace of God and the tools provided by him, then we also realize that we are not the enjoyers of our actions and all actions are meant for his pleasure.

He says that those with purified intellect are free from the false pride of being the doer. They also do not seek to enjoy the fruits of their actions. Thus, they are not bound in the karmic reactions of what they do. Previously in verse 5.10 as well, he had stated that those who are detached from results are never tainted by sin. From a material perspective, they may appear to be working, but from a spiritual perspective, they are free from selfish motivations, and therefore they do not become bound by the results of karma.Rahim Khankhana was a famous poet saint, during the Mughal period in Indian history. Although a Muslim by birth, he was a great devotee of Lord Krishna. When he would give alms in charity, he would lower his eyes. A sweet incident is related about this habit of his. It is said that Saint Tulsidas heard of Rahim’s style of giving alms, and asked him:aisī denī dena jyuñ, kita sīkhe ho sainajyoṅ jyoṅ kara ūñchyo karo, tyoṅ tyoṅ niche naina [v13]“Sir, where did you learn to give alms like this? Your hands are as high as your eyes are low.” Rahim replied beautifully and in all humbleness:denahāra koī aur hai, bhejata hai dina rainaloga bharama hama para kareṅ, yāte niche naina [v14]“The giver is someone else, giving day and night. But the world gives me the credit, and so I lower my eyes.” Understanding that we are not the sole cause responsible for our accomplishments frees us from the egoistic pride of doership.",having described obtuse intellect previous verse shree krishna describes pure intellect he says purified intellect free false pride doer they also not seek enjoy fruits actions thus not bound karmic reactions previously verse well stated detached results never tainted sin from material perspective may appear working spiritual perspective free selfish motivations therefore not become bound results karmarahim khankhana famous poet saint mughal period indian history although muslim birth great devotee lord krishna when would give alms charity would lower eyes a sweet incident related habit it said saint tulsidas heard rahim style giving alms asked aisī denī dena jyuñ kita sīkhe ho sainajyoṅ jyoṅ kara ūñchyo karo tyoṅ tyoṅ niche naina sir learn give alms like your hands high eyes low rahim replied beautifully humbleness denahāra koī aur hai bhejata hai dina rainaloga bharama hama para kareṅ yāte niche naina the giver someone else giving day night but world gives credit i lower eyes understanding not sole cause responsible accomplishments frees us egoistic pride doership
18,18,ज्ञानं ज्ञेयं परिज्ञाता त्रिविधा कर्मचोदना | करणं कर्म कर्तेति त्रिविध: कर्मसंग्रह: ॥18॥,"Knowledge, the object the knowledge and the knower-this is the threefold inducement to action. The comprehension of actions comes under three heads-the instruments, the object and the subject.","In his systematic treatment of the science of action, Shree Krishna explained its limbs. He also explained the karmic reactions of actions, and the process of becoming free from them. Now, he discusses the three-fold factors that propel actions. These are jñāna (knowledge), jñeya (the object of knowledge), and jñātā (the knower). Together, the three are called the jñāna tripuṭī (triad of knowledge).“Knowledge” is a primary impetus for action; it provides understanding to the “knower” about the “object of knowledge.” This triad jointly induces action. For example, knowledge of the remuneration to be paid by the employer motivates employees to work; information of the discovery of gold in various parts of the world led to gold rushes involving feverish migration by workers; awareness of the importance of winning a medal in the Olympics motivates sportspersons to practice for years. Knowledge also has a correlation to the quality of work. For instance, a degree from a top college carries weight in the job market. Corporations realize that people with higher quality knowledge can perform work more proficiently. That’s why good corporations invest in the development of their people, such as sponsoring employees for developmental seminars to further advance their skill set.The second set named is the karm tripuṭī (triad of action). It includes the kartā (doer), kāraṇ (the instrument of action), and karm (the act itself). This triad of work jointly constitutes the content of action. The “doer” utilizes the “instruments of action” to perform “the action.” Having analyzed the constituents of action, Shree Krishna now relates them to the three modes of material nature, to explain why people differ from each other in their motives and actions.",in systematic treatment science action shree krishna explained limbs he also explained karmic reactions actions process becoming free now discusses threefold factors propel actions these jñāna knowledge jñeya object knowledge jñātā knower together three called jñāna tripuṭī triad knowledge knowledge primary impetus action provides understanding knower object knowledge this triad jointly induces action for example knowledge remuneration paid employer motivates employees work information discovery gold various parts world led gold rushes involving feverish migration workers awareness importance winning medal olympics motivates sportspersons practice years knowledge also correlation quality work for instance degree top college carries weight job market corporations realize people higher quality knowledge perform work proficiently that good corporations invest development people sponsoring employees developmental seminars advance skill setthe second set named karm tripuṭī triad action it includes kartā doer kāraṇ instrument action karm act this triad work jointly constitutes content action the doer utilizes instruments action perform action having analyzed constituents action shree krishna relates three modes material nature explain people differ motives actions
18,19,ज्ञानं कर्म च कर्ता च त्रिधैव गुणभेदत: | प्रोच्यते गुणसङ् ख्याने यथावच्छृणु तान्यपि ॥19॥,"Knowledge, action and agent are stated in the teaching about the gunas to be only of three kinds according to the differences of the gunas. Hear about them also as they are.","Shree Krishna once again refers to the three modes of nature. In chapter 14, he had given an introduction about these modes, and described how they bind the soul to the samsara of life and death. Then in chapter 17, he went into great detail about how these three modes influence the kinds of faith people develop and also their choice of foods. He also explained the three categories of sacrifice, charity, and penance. Here, according to the three guṇas, the Lord will explain the three types of knowledge, action, and doers.Amongst the six systems of thought in Indian philosophy, the Sānkhya philosophy (also called puruṣh prakṛiti vāda) is recognized as the authority in the matter of analysis of material nature. It considers the soul as the puruṣh (lord), and thus recognizes many puruṣhas. Prakṛiti is the material nature and includes all things made from it. Sānkhya states the cause for misery is the desire of the puruṣh to enjoy prakṛiti. When this enjoying propensity subsides, then the puruṣh is released from the bondage of material nature attains eternal beatitude. The Sānkhya system does not acknowledge the existence of the Param Puruṣh, or the Supreme Lord, and hence it is insufficient for knowing the Absolute Truth. However, in the matter of knowledge about prakṛiti (material nature), Shree Krishna refers to it as the authority.",shree krishna refers three modes nature in chapter given introduction modes described bind soul samsara life death then chapter went great detail three modes influence kinds faith people develop also choice foods he also explained three categories sacrifice charity penance here according three guṇas lord explain three types knowledge action doersamongst six systems thought indian philosophy sānkhya philosophy also called puruṣh prakṛiti vāda recognized authority matter analysis material nature it considers soul puruṣh lord thus recognizes many puruṣhas prakṛiti material nature includes things made sānkhya states cause misery desire puruṣh enjoy prakṛiti when enjoying propensity subsides puruṣh released bondage material nature attains eternal beatitude the sānkhya system not acknowledge existence param puruṣh supreme lord hence insufficient knowing absolute truth however matter knowledge prakṛiti material nature shree krishna refers authority
18,20,सर्वभूतेषु येनैकं भावमव्ययमीक्षते | अविभक्तं विभक्तेषु तज्ज्ञानं विद्धि सात्विकम् ॥20॥,"Know that knowledge to be originating from sattva through which one sees a single, undecaying, undivided Entity in all the diversified things.","Creation gives the appearance of a panorama of diverse living beings and material entities. But the substratum behind this apparent diversity is the Supreme Lord. Those who possess this vision of knowledge see the unity that exists behind the variety of creation, just as an electrical engineer sees the same electricity flowing through different gadgets, and a goldsmith sees the same gold cast into different ornaments. The Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam states:vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvaṁ yaj jñānam advayam (1.2.11)[v15]“Knowers of the truth have stated that there is only one entity in existence, without a second.” Chaitanya Mahaprabhu referred to God, in his form as Shree Krishna, as advaya jñāna tattva [v16] (one without a second, the only thing and everything that exists in creation), on the basis of the following four criteria:1. Sajātīya bhed śhūnya. (He is one with all similar entities.) Shree Krishna is one with the various other forms of God, such as Ram, Shiv, Vishnu, etc. since these are different manifestations of the one God.Shree Krishna is also one with the souls, who are his tiny fragmental parts. A fragment is one with its whole, just as flames are one with the fire of which they are tiny parts.2. Vijātīya bhed śhūnya. (He is one with all dissimilar entities.) Dissimilar to God is Maya, which is insentient, while God is sentient. However, Maya is an energy of God, and energy is one with its energetic, just as the energies of fire—heat and light—are non-different from it.3. Swagat bhed śhūnya. (The various parts of his body are non-different from him.) The amazing thing about God’s body is that all the parts perform the functions of all the other parts. The Brahma Samhitā states:aṅgāni yasya sakalendriya-vṛitti-manti paśhyanti pānti kalayanti chiraṁ jaganti (5.32)[v17]“With every limb of his body, God can see, hear, talk, smell, eat, and think.” Hence, all the limbs of God’s body are non-different from him.4. Swayam siddha. (He needs the support of no other entity.) Maya and the soul are both dependent upon God for their existence. If he did not energize them, they would cease to exist. On the other hand, God is supremely independent and does not need the support of any other entity for his existence.The Supreme Lord Shree Krishna satisfies all the four above points, and thus he is the advaya jñāna tattva, in other words, he is everything that exists in creation. With this understanding, when we see the entire creation in its unity with God, it is considered sāttvic knowledge. And love based upon such knowledge is not racial or national, rather it is universal.",creation gives appearance panorama diverse living beings material entities but substratum behind apparent diversity supreme lord those possess vision knowledge see unity exists behind variety creation electrical engineer sees electricity flowing different gadgets goldsmith sees gold cast different ornaments the śhrīmad bhāgavatam states vadanti tat tattvavidas tattvaṁ yaj jñānam advayam knowers truth stated one entity existence without second chaitanya mahaprabhu referred god form shree krishna advaya jñāna tattva one without second thing everything exists creation basis following four sajātīya bhed śhūnya he one similar entities shree krishna one various forms god ram shiv vishnu etc since different manifestations one godshree krishna also one souls tiny fragmental parts a fragment one whole flames one fire tiny vijātīya bhed śhūnya he one dissimilar entities dissimilar god maya insentient god sentient however maya energy god energy one energetic energies nondifferent swagat bhed śhūnya the various parts body nondifferent the amazing thing god body parts perform functions parts the brahma samhitā states aṅgāni yasya sakalendriyavṛittimanti paśhyanti pānti kalayanti chiraṁ jaganti with every limb body god see hear talk smell eat think hence limbs god body nondifferent swayam siddha he needs support entity maya soul dependent upon god existence if not energize would cease exist on hand god supremely independent not need support entity existencethe supreme lord shree krishna satisfies four points thus advaya jñāna tattva words everything exists creation with understanding see entire creation unity god considered sāttvic knowledge and love based upon knowledge not racial national rather universal

The history of humankind has repeatedly seen religious zealots who imagine themselves as self-appointed champions of God and defenders of faith.

18,23,नियतं सङ्गरहितमरागद्वेषत: कृतम् | अफलप्रेप्सुना कर्म यतत्सात्विकमुच्यते ॥23॥,"The daily obligatory action which is performed without attachment and without likes or dislikes by one who does not hanker for rewards, that is said to be born of sattva.","Having explained the three kinds of knowledge, Shree Krishna now describes the three kinds of action. In the passage of history, many social scientists and philosophers have given their opinion regarding what is proper action. A few of the important ones and their philosophies are mentioned here.1. The Epicureans of Greece (third century BC) believed that to “eat, drink, and be merry” was right action.2. More refined was the philosophy of Hobbs of England (1588 – 1679) and Helvetius of France (1715 – 1771). They said that if everyone becomes selfish and does not think of others, there will be chaos in the world. So they recommended that along with personal sense gratification we should also care for others. For example, if the husband is sick, the wife should take care of him; and if the wife is sick, the husband should take care of her. In the case where helping others conflicts with the self-interest, they advised that self-interest should be given the priority.3. Joseph Butler’s (1692 – 1752) philosophy went beyond this. He said that the idea of service to others after catering to our own self-interest was wrong. Helping others is a natural human virtue. Even a lioness feeds her cubs while remaining hungry herself. So, service to others must always take priority. However, Butler’s concept of service was limited to the alleviation of material suffering; for example, if a person is hungry, he should be fed. But this does not really solve problems because after six hours the person is hungry again.4. After Butler came Jeremy Bentham (1748 – 1832) and John Stuart Mill (1806 – 1873). They recommended the utilitarian principle of doing what is best for the majority. They suggested following the majority opinion for determining proper behavior. But if the majority is wrong or misguided then this philosophy falls through, for even a thousand ignorant people together cannot match the quality of thought of one learned person.Other philosophers recommended following the dictates of the conscience. They suggested that it is the best guide in determining proper behavior. However, the problem is that everyone’s conscience guides differently. Even in one family, two children have different moral values and conscience. Besides, even one person’s conscience changes over time. If a murderer is asked whether he feels bad on killing people, he replies, “Initially I would feel bad, but later it became as trivial as killing mosquitoes. I feel no remorse.”Regarding proper action, the Mahabharat states:ātmanaḥ pratikūlāni pareśhāṁ na samācharetśhrutiḥ smṛitiḥ sadāchāraḥ svasya cha priyamātmanaḥ (5.15.17)[v18]“If you do not like it when others behave with you in a certain way, then do not behave with them in that way either. But always verify that your behavior is in accordance with the scriptures.” Conduct yourself with others as you desire them to behave with you. The Bible also says, “Do to others as you would have them do to you.” (Luke 6.31)[v19] Here, Shree Krishna declares, in a similar way that action in the mode of goodness is doing one’s duty in accordance with the scriptures. He further adds that such work should be without attachment or aversion, and without desire to enjoy the results.",having explained three kinds knowledge shree krishna describes three kinds action in passage history many social scientists philosophers given opinion regarding proper action a important ones philosophies mentioned the epicureans greece third century bc believed eat drink merry right more refined philosophy hobbs england helvetius france they said everyone becomes selfish not think others chaos world so recommended along personal sense gratification also care others for example husband sick wife take care wife sick husband take care in case helping others conflicts selfinterest advised selfinterest given joseph butler philosophy went beyond he said idea service others catering selfinterest wrong helping others natural human virtue even lioness feeds cubs remaining hungry so service others must always take priority however butler concept service limited alleviation material suffering example person hungry fed but not really solve problems six hours person hungry after butler came jeremy bentham john stuart mill they recommended utilitarian principle best majority they suggested following majority opinion determining proper behavior but majority wrong misguided philosophy falls even thousand ignorant people together not match quality thought one learned personother philosophers recommended following dictates conscience they suggested best guide determining proper behavior however problem everyone conscience guides differently even one family two children different moral values conscience besides even one person conscience changes time if murderer asked whether feels bad killing people replies initially i would feel bad later became trivial killing mosquitoes i feel remorse regarding proper action mahabharat states ātmanaḥ pratikūlāni pareśhāṁ na samācharetśhrutiḥ smṛitiḥ sadāchāraḥ svasya cha priyamātmanaḥ if not like others behave certain way not behave way either but always verify behavior accordance scriptures conduct others desire behave the bible also says do others would you luke here shree krishna declares similar way action mode goodness one duty accordance scriptures he adds work without attachment aversion without desire enjoy results

So, action in the mode of passion is motivated by huge ambition and characterized by intense effort. It entails heavy toil and great physical and mental fatigue. An example of rājasic action is the corporate world. Management executives regularly complain of stress. This is because their actions are usually motivated by pride and an inordinate ambition for power, prestige, and wealth.

Having described the categories of two of them—knowledge and actions—he now moves on to the three kinds of performers of actions. He clarifies that those situated in the mode of goodness are not inactive; rather they work with enthusiasm and determination. The difference is that their work is performed in proper consciousness. Sāttvic doers are mukta sangaḥ, i.e. they do not try to cling to things in worldly attachment, nor do they believe that worldly things can bestow satisfaction to the soul. Hence, they work with noble motives. And since their intentions are pure, they are filled with utsāha (zeal) and dhṛiti (strong resolve) in their endeavors. Their mental attitude results in the least dissipation of energies while working. Thus, they are able to work tirelessly to fulfill their sublime motives.

The Bhagavad Gita itself was spoken to Arjun to equip him with the power of discrimination. At the outset, Arjun was confused about his duty. His inordinate attachment to his relatives had bewildered his judgment regarding proper and improper action. Feeling weak and fearful, and in utter confusion, he had surrendered to the Lord and requested him to enlighten him regarding his duty. Through the divine song of wisdom, Lord Krishna helped Arjun develop his power of discrimination, until he finally concluded: “I have explained to you the knowledge that is more secret than all secrets. Ponder over it deeply, and then do as you wish.” (verse 18.63)The mode of goodness illumines the intellect with the light of knowledge thereby refining its ability to discriminate the right and wrong of things, actions, and sentiments.

It has the Vitamin C of more than 10 oranges. But children dislike it, since it has a bitter taste. Parents in North India encourage children to eat it, saying: āmle kā khāyā aur baḍoṅ kā kahā, bād meṅ patā chalatā hai [v20.1] “The benefits of both these—eating of āmlā and the advice of the elders—are experienced in the future.” Interestingly, after eating the āmlā, in just a couple of minutes, the bitter taste disappears and sweetness is experienced. And the long-term benefits of consuming the natural Vitamin C are undoubtedly numerous. In the above verse, Shree Krishna says that happiness in the mode of goodness is of the same nature; it seems bitter in the short-run, but it tastes like nectar in the end.The Vedas refer to happiness in the mode of goodness as śhreya, which is unpleasant in the present but ultimately beneficial. In contrast to this is preya, which is pleasant in the beginning but ultimately harmful.

God, however, does not consort with his material energy. He independently enjoys the pleasure of his transcendental pastimes. But the living entity enjoys her and thus becomes bound.”Maya’s domain extends from the nether regions to the celestial abode of Brahma. Since the three modes of nature—sattva, rajas, and tamas—are inherent attributes of Maya, they exist in all the material abodes of existence. Hence all living beings in these abodes, be they humans or the celestial gods, are under the sway of these three modes. The difference is only in the relative proportions of the three guṇas. The residents of the nether regions have a predominance of tamas; the residents of the earth planet have a predominance of rajas; and the residents of the celestial abodes have a predominance of sattva.

But how do we discover the perfect profession for ourselves? Here, Shree Krishna explains that people have different natures, according to the guṇas that constitute their personality, and thus different professional duties are suitable for them. The system of varṇāśhram dharma was a scientific organization of society according to svabhāva-prabhavair guṇaiḥ (work based on one’s nature and guṇas). In this system of categorization, there were four āśhrams (stages in life) and four varṇas (occupational categories). The stages in life were: 1) Brahmacharya āśhram (student life), which lasted from birth till the age of 25. 2) Gṛihastha āśhram (household life), which was regular married life, from the age of 25 till 50. 3) Vānaprastha āśhram (semi-renounced life), which was from the age of 50 till 75. In this stage, one continued to live with the family but practiced renunciation. 4) Sanyās āśhram (renounced order), which was from the age of 75 onward, where one gave up all household duties and resided in a holy place, absorbing the mind in God.The four varṇas (occupational categories) were Brahmin (priestly class), Kshatriya (warrior and administrative class), Vaishya (mercantile and farming class), and Shudra (worker class). The varṇas were not considered higher or lower amongst themselves. Since the center of society was God, everyone worked according to their intrinsic qualities to sustain themselves and society, and make their life a success by progressing toward God-realization. Thus, in the varṇāśhram system, there was unity in diversity. Diversity is inherent in nature and can never be removed. We have various limbs in our body, and they all perform different functions. Expecting all limbs to perform the same functions is futile. Seeing them all as different is not a sign of ignorance, but factual knowledge of their utilities. Similarly, the variety amidst human beings cannot be ignored. Even in communist countries where equality is the foremost principle, there are party leaders who formulate ideologies; there is the military that wields guns and protects the nation; there are farmers who cultivate the land; and there are industrial workers who do mechanical jobs. The four classes of occupations exist there as well, despite all attempts to equalize. The varṇāśhram system recognized the diversity in human natures and scientifically prescribed duties and occupations matching people’s natures.However, with the passage of time the varṇāśhram system deteriorated, and the basis of the varṇas changed from one’s nature to one’s birth. The children of Brahmins started calling themselves as Brahmins, irrespective of whether they possessed the corresponding qualities or not. Also, the concept of upper and lower castes got propagated and the upper castes began looking down upon the lower castes. When the system grew rigid and birth-based, it became dysfunctional. This was a social defect that crept in with time, and was not the original intention of the Varṇāśhram system. In the next few verses, according to the original categorization of the system, Shree Krishna maps the guṇas of people with their natural qualities of work.",someone said appropriately find perfect profession like finding perfect lifepartner but discover perfect profession here shree krishna explains people different natures according guṇas constitute personality thus different professional duties suitable the system varṇāśhram dharma scientific organization society according svabhāvaprabhavair guṇaiḥ work based one nature guṇas in system categorization four āśhrams stages life four varṇas occupational categories the stages life brahmacharya āśhram student life lasted birth till age gṛihastha āśhram household life regular married life age till vānaprastha āśhram semirenounced life age till in stage one continued live family practiced renunciation sanyās āśhram renounced order age onward one gave household duties resided holy place absorbing mind godthe four varṇas occupational categories brahmin priestly class kshatriya warrior administrative class vaishya mercantile farming class shudra worker class the varṇas not considered higher lower amongst since center society god everyone worked according intrinsic qualities sustain society make life success progressing toward godrealization thus varṇāśhram system unity diversity diversity inherent nature never removed we various limbs body perform different functions expecting limbs perform functions futile seeing different not sign ignorance factual knowledge utilities similarly variety amidst human beings not ignored even communist countries equality foremost principle party leaders formulate ideologies military wields guns protects nation farmers cultivate land industrial workers mechanical jobs the four classes occupations exist well despite attempts equalize the varṇāśhram system recognized diversity human natures scientifically prescribed duties occupations matching people natureshowever passage time varṇāśhram system deteriorated basis varṇas changed one nature one birth the children brahmins started calling brahmins irrespective whether possessed corresponding qualities not also concept upper lower castes got propagated upper castes began looking upon lower castes when system grew rigid birthbased became dysfunctional this social defect crept time not original intention varṇāśhram system in next verses according original categorization system shree krishna maps guṇas people natural qualities work

His divine plan is for the gradual perfection of all living beings. We all fit into his scheme like tiny cogs in the giant wheel. And he does not expect more from us than the competence he has given to us. Therefore, if we can simply perform our swa-dharma in accordance with our nature and position in life, we will participate in his divine plan for our purification. When done in devotional consciousness our work itself becomes a form of worship.A powerful story illustrating that no duty is ugly or impure, and it is only the consciousness with which we do it that determines its worth, was told to Yudhishthir by Sage Markandeya, in the Vana Parva of the Mahabharat. The story goes that a young sanyāsī went into the forest, where he meditated and performed austerities for a long time. A few years went by, and one day a crow’s droppings fell upon him from the tree above. He looked angrily at the bird, and it fell dead on the ground. The sanyāsī realized he had developed mystical powers as a result of his austerities. He became filled with pride. Shortly thereafter, he went to a house to beg for alms. The housewife came to the door, and requested him to wait a while, since she was nursing her sick husband. This angered the monk and he glanced angrily at her, thinking, “You wretched woman, how dare you make me wait! You do not know my powers.” Reading his mind, the woman replied, “Do not look at me with such anger. I am not a crow to be burnt by your glance.” The monk was shocked, and asked how she knew about the incident? The housewife said she did not practice any austerities, but did her duties with devotion and dedication. By virtue of it, she had been illumined and was able to read his mind. She then asked him to meet a righteous butcher who lived in the town of Mithila, and said that he would answer his questions on dharma. The sanyāsī overcame his initial hesitation of speaking to a lowly butcher, and went to Mithila. The righteous butcher then explained to him that we all have our respective swa-dharma, based upon our past karmas and competence. But if we discharge our natural duty, renouncing the desire for personal gain and rising above the fleeting happiness and misery coming our way, we will purify ourselves and graduate to the next class of dharma. In this manner, by doing the prescribed duties and not running away from them, the soul gradually evolves from its present gross consciousness to divine consciousness. The lecture the butcher delivered is known as the Vyadha Gita of the Mahabharat.This message is particularly applicable to Arjun because he wanted to run away from his dharma, thinking it is painful and miserable. In this verse, Shree Krishna instructs him that by doing his prescribed duty in proper consciousness he will be worshipping the Supreme, and will easily attain perfection.",no soul superfluous god creation his divine plan gradual perfection living beings we fit scheme like tiny cogs giant wheel and not expect us competence given us therefore simply perform swadharma accordance nature position life participate divine plan purification when done devotional consciousness work becomes form worshipa powerful story illustrating duty ugly impure consciousness determines worth told yudhishthir sage markandeya vana parva mahabharat the story goes young sanyāsī went forest meditated performed austerities long time a years went one day crow droppings fell upon tree he looked angrily bird fell dead ground the sanyāsī realized developed mystical powers result austerities he became filled pride shortly thereafter went house beg alms the housewife came door requested wait since nursing sick husband this angered monk glanced angrily thinking you wretched woman dare make wait you not know powers reading mind woman replied do not look anger i not crow burnt glance the monk shocked asked knew incident the housewife said not practice austerities duties devotion dedication by virtue illumined able read mind she asked meet righteous butcher lived town mithila said would answer questions dharma the sanyāsī overcame initial hesitation speaking lowly butcher went mithila the righteous butcher explained respective swadharma based upon past karmas competence but discharge natural duty renouncing desire personal gain rising fleeting happiness misery coming way purify graduate next class dharma in manner prescribed duties not running away soul gradually evolves present gross consciousness divine consciousness the lecture butcher delivered known vyadha gita mahabharatthis message particularly applicable arjun wanted run away dharma thinking painful miserable in verse shree krishna instructs prescribed duty proper consciousness worshipping supreme easily attain perfection
18,47,श्रेयान्स्वधर्मो विगुण: परधर्मात्स्वनुष्ठितात् | स्वभावनियतं कर्म कुर्वन्नाप्नोति किल्बिषम् ॥47॥,"One's own duty, (though) defective, is superior to another's duty well performed. By performing a duty as dictated by one's own nature, one does not incur sin.","When we do our swa-dharma (prescribed occupational duties), there is a two-fold advantage. It is in tune with our disposition. Hence, it is as natural to our personality as flying is to a bird and swimming is to a fish. Secondly, since it is comfortable to the mind, it can almost be done involuntarily, and the consciousness becomes free to be engaged in devotion.Instead, if we abandon our duties thinking them to be defective, and take up another’s duties unsuitable for our nature, we struggle against the innate inclination of our personality. This was exactly Arjun’s situation. His Kshatriya nature was inclined to military and administrative activities. Events drove him to a situation where it was necessary to participate in a war of righteousness. If he were to shirk from his duty and withdraw from the battlefield to practice austerities in the forest, it would not help him spiritually, for even in the forest, he would not be able to get away from his inherent nature. In all likelihood, he would gather the tribal people in the jungle and become their king. Instead, it would be better for him to continue doing his duty born of his nature, and worship God by offering the fruits of his works to him.When one becomes spiritually accomplished the swa-dharma changes. It no longer remains at the bodily platform; it becomes the dharma of the soul, which is devotion to God. At that stage, one is justified in giving up occupational duties and engaging wholeheartedly in devotion because that is now the swa-dharma of one’s nature. For people with that eligibility, Shree Krishna will give the final conclusion in the end of the Bhagavad Gita: “Give up all varieties of dharmas and simply surrender unto me.” (18.66) However, until that stage is reached, the instruction given in this verse applies. Thus, the Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam states:tāvat karmāṇi kurvīta na nirvidyeta yāvatāmat-kathā-śhravaṇādau vā śhraddhā yāvan na jāyate (11.20.9)[v23]“We must keep doing our prescribed occupational duties as long as the taste for devotion through hearing, chanting, and meditating on the leelas of God has not developed.”",when swadharma prescribed occupational duties twofold advantage it tune disposition hence natural personality flying bird swimming fish secondly since comfortable mind almost done involuntarily consciousness becomes free engaged devotioninstead abandon duties thinking defective take another duties unsuitable nature struggle innate inclination personality this exactly arjun situation his kshatriya nature inclined military administrative activities events drove situation necessary participate war righteousness if shirk duty withdraw battlefield practice austerities forest would not help spiritually even forest would not able get away inherent nature in likelihood would gather tribal people jungle become king instead would better continue duty born nature worship god offering fruits works himwhen one becomes spiritually accomplished swadharma changes it longer remains bodily platform becomes dharma soul devotion god at stage one justified giving occupational duties engaging wholeheartedly devotion swadharma one nature for people eligibility shree krishna give final conclusion end bhagavad gita give varieties dharmas simply surrender unto me however stage reached instruction given verse applies thus śhrīmad bhāgavatam states tāvat karmāṇi kurvīta na nirvidyeta yāvatāmatkathāśhravaṇādau vā śhraddhā yāvan na jāyate we must keep prescribed occupational duties long taste devotion hearing chanting meditating leelas god not developed

For all undertakings are surrounded with evil, as fire is with smoke.","People sometimes recoil from their duty because they see a defect in it. Here, Shree Krishna states that no work is free from defect, just as fire naturally has smoke on top of it. For example, we cannot breathe without killing millions of microbes. If we cultivate the land, we destroy innumerable microorganisms. If we succeed against competition in business, we deprive others of wealth. When we eat, we deprive another of food. Since swa-dharma entails activity, it cannot be devoid of defects.But the benefits of the swa-dharma far outweigh its defects. And the foremost benefit is that it provides a comfortable and natural path for one’s purification and elevation. In his book, Making a Life, Making a Living, Mark Albion, who was a professor at the Harvard Business School, cites a study in which the careers of 1,500 business school graduates were tracked from 1960 to 1980. From the beginning, graduates were grouped in two categories. In category A were those who said they wanted to make money first, so that they could do what they really wanted to do later, after they had taken care of their financial concerns. Eighty-three percent fell in category A. In category B were those who pursued their interests first, sure that money would eventually follow. Seventeen percent came in category B. After 20 years, there were 101 millionaires. One person was from category A (who wanted to make money first), and one hundred from category B (who pursued their interest first). The overwhelming majority of the people who became wealthy did so thanks to the work they found profoundly absorbing. Mark Albion concludes that for most people there is a difference between work and play. But if they do what they love, then work becomes play, and they never have to work for another day in their life. That is what Shree Krishna is asking Arjun to do—not to abandon the work that is best suited to his nature, even if it has defects in it, rather to work according to his natural propensity. But for work to be elevating, it must be done in the proper consciousness, described in the next verse.",people sometimes recoil duty see defect here shree krishna states work free defect fire naturally smoke top for example not breathe without killing millions microbes if cultivate land destroy innumerable microorganisms if succeed competition business deprive others wealth when eat deprive another food since swadharma entails activity not devoid defectsbut benefits swadharma far outweigh defects and foremost benefit provides comfortable natural path one purification elevation in book making life making living mark albion professor harvard business school cites study careers business school graduates tracked from beginning graduates grouped two categories in category a said wanted make money first could really wanted later taken care financial concerns eightythree percent fell category a in category b pursued interests first sure money would eventually follow seventeen percent came category b after years millionaires one person category a wanted make money first one hundred category b pursued interest first the overwhelming majority people became wealthy thanks work found profoundly absorbing mark albion concludes people difference work play but love work becomes play never work another day life that shree krishna asking arjun abandon work best suited nature even defects rather work according natural propensity but work elevating must done proper consciousness described next verse
18,49,असक्तबुद्धि: सर्वत्र जितात्मा विगतस्पृह: | नैष्कर्म्यसिद्धिं परमां सन्न्यासेनाधिगच्छति ॥49॥,"He whose intellect remains unattached to everything, who has conquered his internal organs and is desire-less, attains through monasticism the supreme perfection consisting in the state of one free from duties.","In this last chapter, Shree Krishna repeats many of the principles he has already explained. In the beginning of this chapter, he explained to Arjun that merely running away from the responsibilities of life is not sanyās, nor is it renunciation. Now he describes the state of actionlessness, or naiṣhkarmya-siddhi. This state can be reached even amidst the flow of the world by detaching ourselves from events and outcomes, and simply focusing on doing our duty. This is just as water flowing under a bridge enters from one side and flows out from the other. The bridge is neither the recipient of the water nor its distributor; it remains unaffected by its flow. Likewise, the karm yogis do their duty, but keep the mind unaffected by the stream of events. They do not neglect putting in their best efforts in doing their duty, as an act of worship to God, but they leave the final outcome in his hands, and are thus contented and undisturbed with whatever happens.Here’s a simple story to illustrate this point. A man had two daughters; the first was married to a farmer and the second was married to a brick kiln owner. One day, the father rang up the first daughter and inquired how she was doing. She replied, “Father, we are going through economic hardships. Please pray to God for us that we may have plentiful rains in the coming months.” He then rang up the second daughter, and she requested, “Father, we are low on funds. Please request God not to send rains this year, so that we may have lots of sunshine and a good production of bricks.” The father heard the opposite requests of his daughters, and thought, “God alone knows what is best. Let him do what he feels is best.” Such acceptance of the will of God brings detachment from outcomes, despite being immersed in the incessant stream of events in the world.",in last chapter shree krishna repeats many principles already explained in beginning chapter explained arjun merely running away responsibilities life not sanyās renunciation now describes state actionlessness naiṣhkarmyasiddhi this state reached even amidst flow world detaching events outcomes simply focusing duty this water flowing bridge enters one side flows the bridge neither recipient water distributor remains unaffected flow likewise karm yogis duty keep mind unaffected stream events they not neglect putting best efforts duty act worship god leave final outcome hands thus contented undisturbed whatever happenshere simple story illustrate point a man two daughters first married farmer second married brick kiln owner one day father rang first daughter inquired she replied father going economic hardships please pray god us may plentiful rains coming months he rang second daughter requested father low funds please request god not send rains year may lots sunshine good production bricks the father heard opposite requests daughters thought god alone knows best let feels best such acceptance god brings detachment outcomes despite immersed incessant stream events world

It is said that good ideas are a dime a dozen, but they are not worth a plug nickel if you don’t act on them. The theoretical Pundits may have knowledge of all the scriptures in their head, but still be bereft of realization. On the other hand, the karm yogis get opportunities day and night to practice the truths of the scriptures. Thus, the consistent performance of karm yog results in the realization of spiritual knowledge. And when one attains the perfection of naiṣhkarmya-siddhi, or actionlessness while performing work, transcendental knowledge becomes available through experience. Fixed in that knowledge, the karm yogi attains the highest perfection of God-realization. Shree Krishna explains how this happens in the next verse few verses.",it one matter read theoretical knowledge different matter realize practically it said good ideas dime dozen not worth plug nickel act the theoretical pundits may knowledge scriptures head still bereft realization on hand karm yogis get opportunities day night practice truths scriptures thus consistent performance karm yog results realization spiritual knowledge and one attains perfection naiṣhkarmyasiddhi actionlessness performing work transcendental knowledge becomes available experience fixed knowledge karm yogi attains highest perfection godrealization shree krishna explains happens next verse verses

18,54,ब्रह्मभूत: प्रसन्नात्मा न शोचति न काङ् क्षति | सम: सर्वेषु भूतेषु मद्भक्तिं लभते पराम् ॥54॥,"One who has become Brahman and has attained the blissful Self does not grieve or desire. Becoming the same towards all beings, he attains supreme devotion to Me.","Shree Krishna concludes his description of the stage of perfection. The words Brahma-bhūtaḥ mean the state of Brahman realization. Situated in it, one is prasannātmā, meaning serene and unaffected by turbid and painful experiences. Na śhochati means one does not grieve nor feel any incompleteness. Na kāṅkṣhati means one does not crave for any material thing to make one’s happiness complete. Such a yogi sees all living beings with equal vision, realizing the substratum of Brahman in all of them. In such a state, one is situated on the platform of realized knowledge. However, Shree Krishna concludes the verse with a twist. He says that in such a realized state of knowledge, one then attains parā bhakti (divine love) for God.The jñānīs are often fond of saying that bhakti is only to be done as an intermediate step toward Brahman realization. They claim that bhakti is for the purpose of purifying the heart, and at the end of the journey, only jñāna remains. Thus, they recommend that those who possess a strong intellect can ignore devotion and simply cultivate knowledge. But the above verse negates such a viewpoint. Shree Krishna states that having attained the highest realization of jñāna, one develops parā bhakti. Ved Vyas has declared the same in the Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam:ātmārāmāśh cha munayo nirgranthā apy urukramekurvanty ahaitukīṁ bhaktim ittham-bhūta-guṇo hariḥ (1.7.10)[v24]“Even those who are ātmārām (rejoicing in the self), established in self-knowledge, and liberated from material bonds, such perfected souls desire to possess bhakti toward God. The super-excellent qualities of God are such that they attract even the liberated souls.” There are many examples of renowned jñānīs who had attained self-knowledge and were situated in the realization of the formless Brahman. However, when they got a glimpse of the transcendental divine qualities of God, they naturally got drawn toward bhakti. Instances of such jñānīs from each of the four yugas are given here.The greatest jñanīs in Satya Yuga were the four sons of Brahma—Sanat Kumar, Sanatan Kumar, Sanak Kumar, and Sanandan Kumar. They were self-realized from birth, and their minds were always absorbed in the formless Brahman. These four brothers once visited Vaikunth, the divine abode of Lord Vishnu. There, the fragrance from the tulsī (holy basil) leaves at the lotus feet of the Lord entered their nostrils, causing a thrill of ecstasy in their hearts. Immediately, their meditation on the attributeless Brahman ended, and they were immersed in the bliss of divine love for Lord Vishnu. They beseeched him for a boon:kāmaṁ bhavaḥ sva-vṛijinair nirayeṣhu naḥ stāchcheto ’livad yadi nu te padayo rameta (Bhāgavatam 3.15.49)[v25]“O Lord, we do not even mind if you send us to hell, so long as our mind gets the opportunity to drink the divine love bliss that emanates from your lotus feet.” Just imagine, even after having realized the formless Brahman, these foremost jñānīs were willing to reside in hell for the sake of relishing the bliss of the personal form of God.Let us now move on to Tretā Yuga. The topmost jñānī in this age was King Janak. He was the father of Sita, the eternal consort of Lord Ram. He was also known as Videha, one who was beyond all perceptions of the body. His mind would remain ever absorbed in the formless Brahman. One day, however, Sage Vishwamitra came to meet him, along with Lord Ram and Lakshman. What took place then is described in the Ramayan:inhani bilokata ati anurāgā, barabasa brahmasukhahi mana tyāgā [v26]“On seeing Lord Ram, King Janak became detached from the bliss of the formless Brahman, and deeply attached to the personal form of the Supreme Lord.” In this manner, the greatest jñānī of the age of Tretā came to the path of bhakti.”The topmost jñānī in the age of Dwāpar was Shukadev, the son of Sage Ved Vyas. The Puranas describe him as being so elevated that he remained in his mother’s womb for twelve years, thinking that if he came into the world, the material energy, Maya, would overpower him. Finally, Sage Narad came and spoke to him through his mother’s ear, reassuring him that nothing would happen and he should emerge from the womb. Finally, he emerged, and by his yogic power, he expanded his body to that of a twelve-year old and renounced home to live in the forest. There, he soon reached the highest state of samādhi. Years went by, and one day Ved Vyas’s students were cutting wood in the forest, when they saw him in samādhi. They went back and told the Sage about it. He told them to recite a verse in Shukadev’s ears, describing the beauty of the personal form of Lord Krishna:barhāpīḍaṁ naṭa-vara-vapuḥ karṇayoḥ karṇikāraṁbibhrad vāsaḥ kanaka-kapiśhaṁ vaijayantīṁ cha mālāmrandhrān veṇor adhara-sudhayāpūrayan gopa-vṛindairvṛindāraṇyaṁ sva-pada-ramaṇaṁ prāviśhad gīta-kīrtiḥ(Bhāgavatam 10.21.5)[v27]“Shree Krishna is adorned with a peacock feathered crown upon his head, and exhibits his form as the greatest dancer. His ears are decorated with blue karṇikā flowers. His shawl is the color of brilliant gold. He wears a garland made of vaijayantī beads. He fills the holes of his flute with the nectar from his lips. His praises are sung as he enters Vrindavan, surrounded by his cowherd friends, and the marks of his footprints beautify the earth.” Shukadev was absorbed in the formless Brahman when the verse entered his ears. Suddenly, the object of his meditation transformed into the enchanting form of Lord Krishna. He felt so deeply attracted to the bliss of the personal form of God, that he left his samādhi and went back to his father, Ved Vyas. From him, he heard the Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam, which is full of the sweetness of bhakti. Later, on the banks of the Ganges, he related it to King Parikshit, grandson of Arjun. In this manner, the greatest jñānī of the age of Dwāpar got drawn to the path of bhakti.Finally, we come to Kali Yuga. Jagadguru Shankaracharya is widely considered the greatest jñānī of this age. He is widely acclaimed as the propagator of advaita vāda (non-dualism), in which he stated that there is only one entity in existence, which is the nirguṇa (without qualities), nirviśheṣha (attributeless), nirākār (formless) Brahman. However, many people are unaware that from the age of twenty until he left his body at the age of thirty-two, he wrote hundreds of verses in praise of Lord Krishna, Lord Ram, Lord Shiv, Mother Durga, etc. He also visited the four dhāms (centers of spirituality in the four corners of India), and worshipped deities of the personal forms of God in all of them. In Prabodh Sudhākar, he writes:kāmyopāsanayārthayantyanudinaṁ kiñchitphalaṁ swepsitamkechit swargamathāpavargamapare yogādiyajñādibhiḥasmākaṁ yadunandanāṅghriyugaladhyānāvadhānārthināmkiṁ lokena damena kiṁ nṛipatinā swargāpavargaiśhcha kim (verse 250)[v28]“Those who perform righteous actions for the attainment of celestial abodes may do so. Those who desire liberation via the path of jñāna or aṣhṭāṅg yog may pursue that goal. As for me, I want nothing of these two paths. I wish only to engross myself in the nectar of Shree Krishna’s lotus feet. I do not desire either worldly or heavenly pleasures, nor do I desire liberation. I am a rasik who relishes the bliss of divine love.” The fact is that Shankaracharya was a great devotee of Lord Krishna. What he taught in his bhāṣhyas (commentaries) was the need of the times. When he appeared upon the earth, Buddhism was prevailing all over India. In such an environment, to reestablish the faith of the Buddhists in the Vedas, he sidelined devotion while writing his bhāṣhyas. But later, in the numerous stutis (praises) he wrote for the personal forms of God, he revealed his inner devotion. Shankaracharya was thus an example in the age of Kali, of someone who had reached the highest realization of jñāna, and who then did devotion.",shree krishna concludes description stage perfection the

18,55,भक्त्या मामभिजानाति यावान्यश्चास्मि तत्वत: | ततो मां तत्वतो ज्ञात्वा विशते तदनन्तरम् ॥55॥,"Through devotion he knows Me in reality, as to what and who I am. Then, having known Me in truth, he enters (into Me) immediately after that (Knowledge).","Shree Krishna stated in the previous verse that on becoming situated in transcendental knowledge one develops devotion. Now he says that only through devotion can one come to know God’s personality. Previously, the jñānī had realized God as the nirguṇa (quality-less), nirviśheṣha (attribute-less), nirākār (formless) Brahman. But the jñānī had no realization of the personal form of God. The secret of that personal form cannot be known through karm, jñāna, aṣhṭāṅg yog, etc. It is love that opens the door to the impossible and makes way for the inaccessible. Shree Krishna states here that the mystery of God’s form, virtues, pastimes, abode, and associates can only be comprehended through unalloyed devotion. The devotees understand God because they possess the eyes of love.The Padma Purāṇ mentions a beautiful incident illustrating the above truth. A ṛiṣhi by the name of Jabali saw a very effulgent and peaceful maiden meditating in the forest. He requested her to reveal her identity and purpose of meditation. She replied:brahmavidyāhamatulā yogiṁdrairyā cha mṛigyatesāhaṁ hari padāmbhoja kāmyayā suchiraṁ tapaḥcharāmyasmin vane ghore dhyāyantī puruṣhottamambrahmānandena pūrṇāhaṁ tenānandena tṛiptadhīḥtathāpi śhūnyamātmānaṁ manye kṛiṣhṇaratiṁ vinā [v29]“I am Brahma Vidyā (the science of knowing the self, which ultimately leads to the Brahman realization of God). Great yogis and mystics perform austerities to know me. However, I am myself performing severe austerities to develop love at the lotus feet of the personal form of God. I am replete and satiated with the bliss of Brahman. Yet, without loving attachment to Lord Krishna, I feel empty and void.” Thus, mere knowledge is insufficient for relishing the bliss of the personal form of God. It is through bhakti that one enters into this secret and achieves full God-consciousness.",shree krishna stated previous verse becoming situated transcendental knowledge one develops devotion now says devotion one come know god personality previously jñānī realized god nirguṇa qualityless nirviśheṣha attributeless nirākār formless brahman but jñānī realization personal form god the secret personal form not known karm jñāna aṣhṭāṅg yog etc it love opens door impossible makes way inaccessible shree krishna states mystery god form virtues pastimes abode associates comprehended unalloyed devotion the devotees understand god possess eyes lovethe padma purāṇ mentions beautiful incident illustrating truth a ṛiṣhi name jabali saw effulgent peaceful maiden meditating forest he requested reveal identity purpose meditation she replied brahmavidyāhamatulā yogiṁdrairyā cha mṛigyatesāhaṁ hari padāmbhoja kāmyayā suchiraṁ tapaḥcharāmyasmin vane ghore dhyāyantī puruṣhottamambrahmānandena pūrṇāhaṁ tenānandena tṛiptadhīḥtathāpi śhūnyamātmānaṁ manye kṛiṣhṇaratiṁ vinā i brahma vidyā science knowing self ultimately leads brahman realization god great yogis mystics perform austerities know however i performing severe austerities develop love lotus feet personal form god i replete satiated bliss brahman yet without loving attachment lord krishna i feel empty void thus mere knowledge insufficient relishing bliss personal form god it bhakti one enters secret achieves full godconsciousness
18,56,सर्वकर्माण्यपि सदा कुर्वाणो मद्व्यपाश्रय: | मत्प्रसादादवाप्नोति शाश्वतं पदमव्ययम् ॥56॥,"Ever engaging even in all actions, one to whom I am the refuge, attains the eternal, immutable State through My grace.","In the previous verse, Shree Krishna explained that through bhakti the devotees enter into full awareness of him. Equipped with it, they see everything in its connection with God. They see their body, mind, and intellect as the energies of God; they see their material possessions as the property of God; they see all living beings as parts and parcels of God; and they see themselves as his tiny servants. In that divine consciousness, they do not give up work, rather they renounce the pride of being the doers and enjoyers of work. They see all work as devotional service to the Supreme, and they depend upon him for its performance.Then, upon leaving their body, they go to the divine abode of God. Just as the material realm is made from the material energy, the divine realm is made from the spiritual energy. Hence, it is free from the defects of material nature, and is perfect in every way. It is sat-chit-ānand i.e., full of eternality, knowledge, and bliss. Regarding his divine realm, Shree Krishna had said in verse 15.6: “Neither the sun nor the moon, nor fire can illumine that Supreme Abode of Mine. Having gone There, one does not return to this material world again.”The various forms of God have their own personal abodes in the spiritual realm, where they engage in eternal loving pastimes with their devotees. Those who perfect their selfless loving service toward him go to the abode of their worshipped form of God. Thus, the devotees of Lord Krishna go to Golok; those of Lord Vishnu go to Vaikunth; the devotees of Lord Ram go to Saket; the worshippers of Lord Shiv go to Shiv Lok; those of Mother Durga go to Devi Lok, etc. The devotees, who reach these divine abodes, having attained him, participate in his divine pastimes that are imbued with the perfection of the spiritual energy.",in previous verse shree krishna explained bhakti devotees enter full awareness equipped see everything connection god they see body mind intellect energies god see material possessions property god see living beings parts parcels god see tiny servants in divine consciousness not give work rather renounce pride doers enjoyers work they see work devotional service supreme depend upon performancethen upon leaving body go divine abode god just material realm made material energy divine realm made spiritual energy hence free defects material nature perfect every way it satchitānand ie full eternality knowledge bliss regarding divine realm shree krishna said verse neither sun moon fire illumine supreme abode mine having gone there one not return material world again the various forms god personal abodes spiritual realm engage eternal loving pastimes devotees those perfect selfless loving service toward go abode worshipped form god thus devotees lord krishna go golok lord vishnu go vaikunth devotees lord ram go saket worshippers lord shiv go shiv lok mother durga go devi lok etc the devotees reach divine abodes attained participate divine pastimes imbued perfection spiritual energy
18,57,चेतसा सर्वकर्माणि मयि सन्न्यस्य मत्पर: | बुद्धियोगमुपाश्रित्य मच्चित्त: सततं भव ॥57॥,"Mentally surrendering all actions to Me and accepting Me as the supreme, have your mind ever fixed on Me by resorting to the concentration of your intellect.","Yog means “union,” and buddhi yog means “having the intellect united with God.” This union of the intellect occurs when it is firmly convinced that everything in existence has emanated from God, is connected to him, and is meant for his satisfaction. Let us understand the position of the intellect in our internal system.Within our body is the subtle antaḥ karaṇ, which we also refer to colloquially as the heart, or the etheric heart. It has four aspects to it. When it creates thoughts, we call it mana, or mind. When it analyses and decides, we call it buddhi, or intellect. When it gets attached to an object or person, we call it chitta. When it identifies with the attributes of the body and becomes proud, we call it ahankār, or ego.In this internal machinery, the position of the intellect is dominant. It makes decision, while the mind desires in accordance with those decisions, and the chitta gets attached to the objects of affection. For example, if the intellect decides that security is the most important thing in the world, then the mind always yearns for security in life. Throughout the day, we humans control our mind with the intellect. That is why anger flows downward. The CEO shouts at the director. The director does not shout back, because the intellect realizes that it will cost him the job; he vents his anger at the manager. The manager controls himself, despite feeling vexed with the director; but finds release by shouting at the foreman. The foreman takes it all out at the worker. The worker purges his frustration on the wife. The wife shouts at the children. In each case, the intellect decides where it is dangerous to get angry, and where it does not have repercussions. The example illustrates that as human beings our intellect possesses the ability to control the mind.Thus, we must cultivate the intellect with proper knowledge and use it to guide the mind in the proper direction. This is what Shree Krishna means by buddhi yog—developing a resolute decision of the intellect that all work and all things are meant for the pleasure of God. For such a person of resolute intellect, the chitta easily gets attached to God.",yog means union buddhi yog means intellect united god this union intellect occurs firmly convinced everything existence emanated god connected meant satisfaction let us understand position intellect internal systemwithin body subtle antaḥ karaṇ also refer colloquially heart etheric heart it four aspects when creates thoughts call mana mind when analyses decides call buddhi intellect when gets attached object person call chitta when identifies attributes body becomes proud call ahankār egoin internal machinery position intellect dominant it makes decision mind desires accordance decisions chitta gets attached objects affection for example intellect decides security important thing world mind always yearns security life throughout day humans control mind intellect that anger flows downward the ceo shouts director the director not shout back intellect realizes cost job vents anger manager the manager controls despite feeling vexed director finds release shouting foreman the foreman takes worker the worker purges frustration wife the wife shouts children in case intellect decides dangerous get angry not repercussions the example illustrates human beings intellect possesses ability control mindthus must cultivate intellect proper knowledge use guide mind proper direction this shree krishna means buddhi resolute decision intellect work things meant pleasure god for person resolute intellect chitta easily gets attached god

(Your) nature impel you!","Speaking in a chastising mood, Shree Krishna now delivers a word of caution. We should not think we have complete liberty to do what we wish. The soul does not lead an independent existence; it is dependent upon God’s creation in many ways. In the materially bound state, it is under the influence of the three guṇas. The combination of guṇas creates our nature, and according to its dictates, we are compelled to act. Hence, we do not have absolute freedom to say, “I will do what I like.” We have to choose between the good advice of God and the scriptures or the compulsions of our nature. There is an anecdote regarding one’s nature. A soldier retired after thirty years of service and returned to his hometown. One day, he was standing in the coffee shop drinking a cup of tea, when a friend thought of a practical joke. He screamed from behind, “Attention!” Responding to that command had become a part of the soldier’s nature. Involuntarily, he dropped the cup from his hand and put his hands by his side. Shree Krishna warns Arjun that by nature he is a warrior, and if, out of pride, he decides not to listen to good advice, his Kshatriya nature will still compel him to fight.",speaking chastising mood shree krishna delivers word caution we not think complete liberty wish the soul not lead independent existence dependent upon god creation many ways in materially bound state influence three guṇas the combination guṇas creates nature according dictates compelled act hence not absolute freedom say i i like we choose good advice god scriptures compulsions nature there anecdote regarding one nature a soldier retired thirty years service returned hometown one day standing coffee shop drinking cup tea friend thought practical joke he screamed behind attention responding command become part soldier nature involuntarily dropped cup hand put hands side shree krishna warns arjun nature warrior pride decides not listen good advice kshatriya nature still compel fight

18,62,तमेव शरणं गच्छ सर्वभावेन भारत | तत्प्रसादात्परां शान्तिं स्थानं प्राप्स्यसि शाश्वतम् ॥62॥,"Take refuge in Him alone with your whole being, O scion of the Bharata dynasty. Through His grace you will attain the supreme Peace and the eternal Abode.","Being dependent upon God, the soul must also depend upon his grace to get out of its present predicament and attain the ultimate goal. Self-effort will never suffice for this. But if God bestows his grace, he will grant his divine knowledge and divine bliss upon the soul, and release it from the bondage of the material energy. Shree Krishna emphasizes that by his grace, one will attain eternal beatitude and the imperishable abode. However, to receive that grace, the soul must qualify itself by surrendering to God. Even a worldly father will not hand over all his precious possessions to his child until the child becomes responsible enough to utilize them properly. Similarly, the grace of God is not a whimsical act; he has perfectly rational rules on the basis of which he bestows it.If God does not follow rules while bestowing grace, people’s faith in him will break. Let us say, for example, that there is a father who has two sons. He instructs both of them to work hard in the paddy field as it is the cultivation season. One son toils and sweats it out in the blazing son all day long. In the night when he returns, the father says, “Well done my son. You are obedient, hard-working, and loyal. Here is your reward. Take $500 and do what you like with it.” The second son does nothing—he lies in bed all day long, sleeping, drinking, smoking, and abusing his father. At night, suppose the father says, “Never mind, after all you are also my son. Here is $500; go and enjoy yourself with it.” The result of this will be that the first son’s motivation to work hard will be smothered. He will say, “If this is my father’s reward system, then why should I work? I will also do nothing, for I will receive the $500 in any case.” Likewise, if God grants his grace without our becoming qualified for it, all those who became saints in the past will complain, “What is this? We strived for many lifetimes to purify ourselves and then we became recipients of God’s grace, but this person received it without making himself eligible. Then our effort for self-improvement was meaningless.” God says, “I do not behave in this irrational manner. I have an eternal condition on the basis of which I bestow my grace. And I have declared this in all the scriptures.” The Śhwetāśhvatar Upaniṣhad states:yo brahmāṇaṁ vidadhāti pūrvaṁ yo vai vedānśh cha prahiṇoti tasmaitaṁ ha devaṁ ātma-buddhi-prakāśhaṁ mumukṣhur vai śharaṇam ahaṁ prapadye (6.18)[v30]“We take shelter of that Supreme Being who created Brahma and others. It is by his grace that the soul and intellect get illumined.” The Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam states:mām ekam eva śharaṇam ātmānaṁ sarva-dehināmyāhi sarvātma-bhāvena mayā syā hy akuto-bhayaḥ (11.12.15)[v31]“O Uddhav! Giving up all forms of mundane social and religious conventions, simply surrender unto me, the Supreme Soul of all souls. Only then can you cross over this material ocean and become fearless.”Shree Krishna also stated it in verse 7.14 of the Bhagavad Gita: “My divine energy Maya, consisting of the three modes of nature, is very difficult to overcome. But those who surrender unto me cross over it easily.”The Ramayan also says:sanamukha hoi jīva mohi jabahīṅ, janma koṭi agha nāsahiṅ tabahīṅ [v32]“The moment the soul surrenders to God, its account of sinful deeds in endless past lifetimes is destroyed by his grace.”In the above verse of the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna has reiterated the principle of the necessity for surrendering to God to receive his grace. The details of what it means to surrender are explained in the Hari Bhakti Vilas, Bhakti Rasamrita Sindhu, the Vayu Puran, and the Ahirbudhni Samhita in the following manner:ānukūlyasya saṅkalpaḥ pratikūlyasya varjanamrakṣhiṣhyatīti viśhvāso goptṛitve varaṇaṁ tathāātmanikṣhepa kārpaṇye ṣhaḍvidhā śharaṇāgatiḥ(Hari Bhakti Vilas 11.676)[v33]The above verse explains the six aspects of surrender to God:1. To desire only in accordance with the desire of God.  By nature, we are his servants, and the duty of a servant is to fulfill the desire of the master. So as surrendered devotees of God, we must make our will conform to the divine will of God. A dry leaf is surrendered to the wind. It does not complain whether the wind lifts it up, takes it forward or backward, or drops it to the ground. Similarly, we too must learn to be happy in the happiness of God.2. Not to desire against the desire of God.  Whatever we get in life is a result of our past and present karmas. However, the fruits of the karmas do not come by themselves. God notes them and gives the results at the appropriate time. Since God himself dispenses the results, we must learn to serenely accept them. Usually, when people get wealth, fame, pleasure, and luxuries in the world, they forget to thank God. However, if they get suffering, they blame God for it, “Why did God do this to me?” The second aspect of surrender means to not complain about whatever God gives us.3. To have firm faith that God is protecting us. God is the eternal father. He is taking care of all the living beings in creation. There are trillions of ants on the planet earth, and all of them need to eat regularly. Do you ever find that a few thousand ants in your garden have died of starvation? God ensures that they are all provided for. On the other hand, elephants eat mounds of food every day. God provides for them too. Even a worldly father cares and provides for his children. Why then should we doubt whether our eternal father, God, will take care of us or not? To have firm faith in his protection is the third aspect of surrender.4. To maintain an attitude of gratitude toward God. We have received so many priceless gifts from the Lord. The earth that we walk upon, the sunlight with which we see, the air that we breathe, and the water that we drink, are all given to us by God. In fact, it is because of him that we exist; he has brought us to life and imparted consciousness in our soul. We are not paying him any tax in return, but we must at least feel deeply indebted for all that he has given to us. This is the sentiment of gratitude.The reverse of this is the sentiment of ungratefulness. For example, a father does so much for his child. The child is told to be grateful to his father for this. But the child responds, “Why should I be grateful? His father took care of him and he is taking care of me.” This is ingratitude toward the worldly father. To be grateful toward God, our eternal Father, for all that he has given to us, is the fourth aspect of surrender.5. To see everything we possess as belonging to God.  God created this entire world; it existed even before we were born, and will continue to exist even after we die. Hence, the true owner of everything is God alone. When we think something belongs to us, we forget the proprietorship of God. Let us say that someone comes into your house when you are not at home. He wears your clothes, takes things out of your refrigerator, eats them, and sleeps on your bed. On returning, you ask indignantly, “What have you been doing in my house?” He says, “I have not damaged anything. I have merely used everything properly. Why are you getting annoyed?” You will reply, “You may not have destroyed anything, but it all belongs to me. If you use it without my permission, you are a thief.” Similarly, this world and everything in it belongs to God. To remember this and give up our sense of proprietorship is the fifth aspect of surrender.6. To give up the pride of having surrendered.  If we become proud of the good deeds that we have done, the pride dirties our heart and undoes the good we have done. That is why it is important to keep an attitude of humbleness: “If I was able to do something nice, it was only because God inspired my intellect in the right direction. Left to myself, I would never have been able to do it.” To keep such an attitude of humility is the sixth aspect of surrender.If we can perfect these six points of surrender in ourselves, we will fulfill God’s condition and he will bestow his Grace upon us.",being dependent upon god soul must also depend upon grace get present predicament attain ultimate goal selfeffort never suffice but god

18,63,इति ते ज्ञानमाख्यातं गुह्याद्गुह्यतरं मया | विमृश्यैतदशेषेण यथेच्छसि तथा कुरु ॥63॥,"To you has been imparted by Me this knowledge [Derived in the instrumental sense of 'means of knowledge'; i.e. the scripture Gita.] which is more secret than any secret. Pondering over this as a whole, do as you like.","A secret is that knowledge which is not accessible to majority of the people. Most of the laws of Physics were a secret until a few centuries ago, and many still continue to remain so. Spiritual knowledge is profound and not realizable through direct perception. It needs to be learnt through the Guru and the scriptures. Hence, it is described as secret. In the second chapter, Shree Krishna had revealed knowledge of the soul, which is guhya, or secret knowledge. In the seventh and eighth chapters, he explained knowledge of his powers, which is guhyatar, or more secret. In the ninth and subsequent chapters, he revealed knowledge of his bhakti, which is guhyatamam, or most secret. In the present chapter, verse 55, he revealed that he can be known in his personal form only by bhakti. Shree Krishna is now concluding the Bhagavad Gita. Having spoken the eighteen chapters, including most secret knowledge to Arjun, he now leaves the choice in Arjun’s hands. He says, “I have revealed to you profound and confidential knowledge. Now the choice is in your hands.” Lord Ram made a similar statement to the residents of Ayodhya. He invited them all for his discourse:eka bāra raghunātha bolāe, guru dwija purabāsī saba āe (Ramayan) [v34]“Once, Lord Ram called all the residents of Ayodhya. Everyone, including Guru Vasishth came to hear him.” In the discourse, Lord Ram explained to them the purpose of human life and the way to accomplish it. In the end, he concluded:nahiṅ anīti nahiṅ kachhu prabhutāī, sunahu karahu jo tumhahi sohāī (Ramayan) [v35]“The advice I have given to you is neither incorrect nor coercive. Listen to it carefully, contemplate over it, and then do what you wish.”This free will to choose between available alternatives has been given to the soul by God. The freedom of choice is not infinite. One cannot decide, “I choose to be the most intelligent person in the world.” Our choices are limited by our past and present karmas. However, we do possess a certain amount of free will, for we are not machines in the hands of God. Sometimes people question that if God had not given us free will then we would not have done any evil. But then we would not have done anything good either. The opportunity to do good always comes with the danger of doing evil. More importantly, God wants us to love him, and love is only possible when there is a choice. A machine cannot love for it does not have any freedom of choice. God created us with free will and provided us with choices so that we may choose him and thereby exercise our love for him. Even the all-powerful God cannot force the soul to love and surrender to him; this decision has to be made by the soul itself. Here, Shree Krishna is calling Arjun’s attention to his free will and asking him to choose.",a secret knowledge not accessible majority people most laws physics secret centuries ago many still continue remain spiritual knowledge profound not realizable direct perception it needs learnt guru scriptures hence described secret in second chapter shree krishna revealed knowledge soul guhya secret knowledge in seventh eighth chapters explained knowledge powers guhyatar secret in ninth subsequent chapters revealed knowledge bhakti guhyatamam secret in present chapter verse revealed known personal form bhakti shree krishna concluding bhagavad gita having spoken eighteen chapters including secret knowledge arjun leaves choice arjun hands he says i revealed profound confidential knowledge now choice hands lord ram made similar statement residents ayodhya he invited discourse eka bāra raghunātha bolāe guru dwija purabāsī saba āe ramayan once lord ram called residents ayodhya everyone including guru vasishth came hear him in discourse lord ram explained purpose human life way accomplish in end concluded nahiṅ anīti nahiṅ kachhu prabhutāī sunahu karahu jo tumhahi sohāī ramayan the advice i given neither incorrect coercive listen carefully contemplate wish this free choose available alternatives given soul god the freedom choice not infinite one not decide i choose intelligent person world our choices limited past present karmas however possess certain amount free not machines hands god sometimes people question god not given us free would not done evil but would not done anything good either the opportunity good always comes danger evil more importantly god wants us love love possible choice a machine not love not freedom choice god created us free provided us choices may choose thereby exercise love even allpowerful god not force soul love surrender decision made soul here shree krishna calling arjun attention free asking choose

Before sharing it, he considers many things, such as the preparedness of the student to receive it, comprehend it, benefit from it, etc. In the beginning of the Bhagavad Gita, Arjun was bewildered by the problems facing him and asked for guidance from Shree Krishna. The Lord enlightened him with great care and consideration, uplifting his understanding a little by little, through the eighteen chapters. Having seen Arjun receive the message so well, Shree Krishna now feels confident that he will be able to grasp the final and most profound knowledge as well. Further, he says iṣhṭo ‘si me dṛiḍhamiti, meaning, “I am speaking this to you because you are my very dear friend. So I care for you deeply and sincerely desire your best interest.”",a teacher may know deepest secret not necessarily reveal student before sharing considers many things preparedness student receive comprehend benefit etc in beginning bhagavad gita arjun bewildered problems facing asked guidance shree krishna the lord enlightened great care consideration uplifting understanding little little eighteen chapters having seen arjun receive message well shree krishna feels confident able grasp final profound knowledge well further says iṣhṭo si dṛiḍhamiti meaning i speaking dear friend so i care deeply sincerely desire best interest

Here, he repeats the first line of verse 9.34, asking him to engage in his devotion. By developing deep love for Shree Krishna and having his mind always absorbed in exclusive devotion to him, Arjun will be assured of attaining the supreme destination. The perfect example of someone completely absorbed in devotion was King Ambarish. The Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam describes:sa vai manaḥ kṛiṣhṇa-padāravindayor vachāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇanekarau harer mandira-mārjanādiṣhu śhrutiṁ chakārāchyuta-sat-kathodayemukunda-liṅgālaya-darśhane dṛiśhau tad-bhṛitya-gātra-sparśhe ’ṅga-saṅgamamghrāṇaṁ cha tat-pāda-saroja-saurabhe śhrīmat-tulasyā rasanāṁ tad-arpitepādau hareḥ kṣhetra-padānusarpaṇe śhiro hṛiṣhīkeśha-padābhivandanekāmaṁ cha dāsye na tu kāma-kāmyayā yathottamaśhloka-janāśhrayā ratiḥ(9.4.18-20) [v36]“Ambarish absorbed his mind on the lotus feet of Shree Krishna; he used his speech in glorifying the qualities of God, his hands in cleaning the temple, and his ears in hearing the divine pastimes of the Lord. He engaged his eyes in seeing the deities; he used his limbs in touching the bodies of the devotees, his nose in smelling the fragrance of the Tulsī (holy basil) leaves offered at the feet of the Lord, and his tongue in tasting prasād (food sanctified by offering to God). He utilized his feet for walking to the holy abodes, and his head in offering obeisance to the lotus feet of God. He offered all paraphernalia, such as garlands and sandalwood, in the service of God. He did all this, not with some selfish motive, but only to attain the selfless service of Lord Krishna, through purification.”The instruction to wholeheartedly engage in devotion is the essence of all the scriptures, and the summum bonum of all knowledge. However, this is not the most confidential knowledge that Shree Krishna referred to, for he has already mentioned this earlier. He now reveals this supreme secret in this next verse.",in chapter shree krishna promised arjun reveal secret knowledge gone describe glories bhakti here repeats first line verse asking engage devotion by developing deep love shree krishna mind always absorbed exclusive devotion arjun assured attaining supreme destination the perfect example someone completely absorbed devotion king ambarish the śhrīmad bhāgavatam describes sa vai manaḥ kṛiṣhṇapadāravindayor vachāṁsi vaikuṇṭhaguṇānuvarṇanekarau harer mandiramārjanādiṣhu śhrutiṁ chakārāchyutasatkathodayemukundaliṅgālayadarśhane dṛiśhau tadbhṛityagātrasparśhe ṅgasaṅgamamghrāṇaṁ cha tatpādasarojasaurabhe śhrīmattulasyā rasanāṁ tadarpitepādau hareḥ kṣhetrapadānusarpaṇe śhiro hṛiṣhīkeśhapadābhivandanekāmaṁ cha dāsye na tu kāmakāmyayā yathottamaśhlokajanāśhrayā ratiḥ ambarish absorbed mind lotus feet shree krishna used speech glorifying qualities god hands cleaning temple ears hearing divine pastimes lord he engaged eyes seeing deities used limbs touching bodies devotees nose smelling fragrance tulsī holy basil leaves offered feet lord tongue tasting prasād food sanctified offering god he utilized feet walking holy abodes head offering obeisance lotus feet god he offered paraphernalia garlands sandalwood service god he not selfish motive attain selfless service lord krishna purification the instruction wholeheartedly engage devotion essence scriptures summum bonum knowledge however not confidential knowledge shree krishna referred already mentioned earlier he reveals supreme secret next verse
18,66,सर्वधर्मान्परित्यज्य मामेकं शरणं व्रज | अहं त्वां सर्वपापेभ्यो मोक्षयिष्यामि मा शुच: ॥66॥,"Abandoning all forms of rites and duties, take refuge in Me alone. I shall free you from all sins. (Therefore) do not grieve.","All along, Shree Krishna had been asking Arjun to do two things simultaneously—engage his mind in devotion, and engage his body in fulfilling his material duty as a warrior. He thus wanted Arjun not to give up his Kshatriya dharma, but to do devotion alongside with it. This is the principle of karm yog. Now, Shree Krishna reverses this teaching by saying that here is no need to fulfill even material dharma. Arjun can renounce all material duties and simply surrender to God. This is the principle of karm sanyās. Here, one may question that if we give up all our material dharmas will we not incur sin? Shree Krishna tells Arjun not to fear; he will absolve him from all sins, and liberate him from material existence.To comprehend this instruction of Shree Krishna, we need to understand the term dharma. It comes from the root word dhṛi, which means dhāraṇ karane yogya, or “responsibilities, duties, thoughts, and actions that are appropriate for us.” There are actually two kinds of dharmas—material dharma and spiritual dharma. These two kinds of dharma are based upon two different understandings of the “self.” When we identify ourselves as the body, then our dharma is determined in accordance with our bodily designations, obligations, duties, and norms. Hence, serving the bodily parents, fulfilling the responsibilities to society, nation, etc. are all bodily dharma. This is also called apara dharma or material dharma. This includes the dharma as a Brahmin, Kshatriya, etc. However, when we identify ourselves as the soul, we have no material designations of varṇa (social class) and āśhram (status in life). The soul’s Father, Mother, Friend, Beloved, and resting place are all God. Hence our one and only dharma becomes loving devotional service to God. This is also called para dharma or spiritual dharma.If one leaves the material dharma it is considered a sin due to dereliction of duty. But if one leaves material dharma and takes the shelter of spiritual dharma, it is not a sin. The Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam states:devarṣhi-bhūtāpta-nṛiṇāṁ pitṝīṇāṁ na kiṅkaro nāyam ṛiṇī cha rājansarvātmanā yaḥ śharaṇaṁ śharaṇyaṁ gato mukundaṁ parihṛitya kartam (11.5.41)[v37]This verse explains that for those who do not surrender to God, there are five debts—to the celestial gods, to the sages, to the ancestors, to other humans, and to other living beings. The varṇāśhram system includes various procedures for releasing ourselves from these five kinds of debts. However, when we surrender to God, we are automatically released from all these debts, just as by watering the roots of a tree, all its branches, twigs, leaves, flowers, and fruit automatically get watered. Similarly, by fulfilling our duty to God, we automatically fulfill our duty to everyone. Hence, there is no sin in renouncing material dharma if we are properly situated in spiritual dharma. In fact, the ultimate goal is to engage completely and wholeheartedly in spiritual dharma. The Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam states:ājñāyaivaṁ guṇān doṣhān mayādiṣhṭān api svakāndharmān santyajya yaḥ sarvān māṁ bhajeta sa tu sattamaḥ (11.11.32) [v38]“I have given innumerable instructions regarding the performance of bodily dharma in the Vedas. But those who realize the shortcomings in these, and renounce all prescribed duties, to simply engage in my devotional service, I consider them to be the best sādhaks.” In the Ramayan, we read how Lakshman renounced all material duties to accompany Lord Ram in the forest. He said:guru pitu mātu na jānahu kāhū, kahahu subhāū nātha patiyāūmore sabahiñ eka tumha swāmī, dinabhandhu ura antarayamī [v39]“O Lord, please believe me, I do not know any teacher, father, mother, etc. As far as I am concerned, you, the savior of the fallen and the knower of the heart, are my Master and my everything.” Similarly, Prahlad said:mātā nāsti pitā na ’sti na ’sti me swajano janaḥ [v40]“I do not know any mother, father, or relative (God is everything to me).”In the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna gave Arjun sequentially higher instructions. Initially, he instructed Arjun to do karm, i.e. his material dharma as a warrior (verse 2.31). But material dharma does not result in God-realization; it leads to the celestial abodes, and once the pious merits are depleted one has to come back. Hence, Shree Krishna next instructed Arjun to do karm yog, i.e. his material dharma with the body and spiritual dharma with the mind. He asked Arjun to fight the war with the body and remember God with the mind (verse 8.7). This instruction of karm yog forms the major portion of the Bhagavad Gita. Now in the very end, Shree Krishna instructs Arjun to practice karm sanyās, i.e. renounce all material dharma and simply adopt spiritual dharma, which is love for God. He should thus fight, not because it is his duty as a warrior, but because God wants him to do so.But why did Shree Krishna not give this instruction to Arjun earlier? Why did he seem to clearly extol just the reverse in verse 5.2 when he stated karm yog superior as to karm sanyās? Lord Krishna clearly explains this in the next verse.",all along shree krishna asking arjun two things mind devotion engage body fulfilling material duty warrior he thus wanted arjun not give kshatriya dharma devotion alongside this principle karm yog now shree krishna reverses teaching saying need fulfill even material dharma arjun renounce material duties simply surrender god this principle karm sanyās here one may question give material dharmas not incur sin shree krishna tells arjun not fear absolve sins liberate material existenceto comprehend instruction shree krishna need understand term dharma it comes root word dhṛi means dhāraṇ karane yogya responsibilities duties thoughts actions appropriate us there actually two kinds dharma spiritual dharma these two kinds dharma based upon two different understandings self when identify body dharma determined accordance bodily designations obligations duties norms hence serving bodily parents fulfilling responsibilities society nation etc bodily dharma this also called apara dharma material dharma this includes dharma brahmin kshatriya etc however identify soul material designations varṇa social class āśhram status life the soul father mother friend beloved resting place god hence one dharma becomes loving devotional service god this also called para dharma spiritual dharmaif one leaves material dharma considered sin due dereliction duty but one leaves material dharma takes shelter spiritual dharma not sin the śhrīmad bhāgavatam states devarṣhibhūtāptanṛiṇāṁ pitṝīṇāṁ na kiṅkaro nāyam ṛiṇī cha rājansarvātmanā yaḥ śharaṇaṁ śharaṇyaṁ gato mukundaṁ parihṛitya kartam this verse explains not surrender god five celestial gods sages ancestors humans living beings the varṇāśhram system includes various procedures releasing five kinds debts however surrender god automatically released debts watering roots tree branches twigs leaves flowers fruit automatically get watered similarly fulfilling duty god automatically fulfill duty everyone hence sin renouncing material dharma properly situated spiritual dharma in fact ultimate goal engage completely wholeheartedly spiritual dharma the śhrīmad bhāgavatam states ājñāyaivaṁ guṇān doṣhān mayādiṣhṭān api svakāndharmān santyajya yaḥ sarvān māṁ bhajeta sa tu sattamaḥ i given innumerable instructions regarding performance bodily dharma vedas but realize shortcomings renounce prescribed duties simply engage devotional service i consider best sādhaks in ramayan read lakshman renounced material duties accompany lord ram forest he said guru pitu mātu na jānahu kāhū kahahu subhāū nātha patiyāūmore sabahiñ eka tumha swāmī dinabhandhu ura antarayamī o lord please believe i not know teacher father mother etc as far i concerned savior fallen knower heart master everything similarly prahlad said mātā nāsti pitā na sti na sti swajano janaḥ i not know mother father relative god everything in bhagavad gita shree krishna gave arjun sequentially higher instructions initially instructed arjun karm ie material dharma warrior verse but material dharma not result godrealization leads celestial abodes pious merits depleted one come back hence shree krishna next instructed arjun karm yog ie material dharma body spiritual dharma mind he asked arjun fight war body remember god mind verse this instruction karm yog forms major portion bhagavad gita now end shree krishna instructs arjun practice karm sanyās ie renounce material dharma simply adopt spiritual dharma love god he thus fight not duty warrior god wants sobut shree krishna not give instruction arjun earlier why seem clearly extol reverse verse stated karm yog superior karm sanyās lord krishna clearly explains next verse
18,67,इदं ते नातपस्काय नाभक्ताय कदाचन | न चाशुश्रूषवे वाच्यं न च मां योऽभ्यसूयति ॥67॥,"This (that I have taught) you should not ever be taught to one who is devoid of austerities and to one who is not a devotee; also, neither to one who does not render service, nor as well to one who cavils at Me.","It was explained in the previous verse that if one is situated in loving devotion to God, there is no sin in giving up the material duties. However, there is one problem with this instruction. If we have not yet become established in love for God, and we prematurely give up material duties, we will be neither here nor there. Thus, karm sanyās is only for those who are qualified for it. And what we are qualified for has to be determined by our Guru, who knows our capabilities and the stringency of the paths. If a student wishes to become a graduate, it will not do to directly go and attend the graduation ceremony. We will have to begin studies sequentially from grade one. Similarly, the vast majority of people are eligible for karm yog, and it would be a great folly for them to prematurely take karm sanyās. It is better to instruct them to fulfill their bodily dharma and practice devotion alongside. That is why, in this verse Shree Krishna says that this confidential teaching given by him is not for everyone. Before sharing it with others, we should check their eligibility for this teaching.This word of caution applies specifically for the confidential teachings of the previous verse, and in general, for the entire message of the Bhagavad Gita. If it is explained to someone who is envious of Shree Krishna, that person may respond, “Shree Krishna was very conceited. He kept asking Arjun to glorify him.” By misunderstanding the teachings, the faithless listener will be harmed by the divine message. The Padma Purāṇ also states:aśhraddadhāne vimukhe ’py aśhṛiṇvati yaśh chopadeśhaḥ śhiva-nāmāparādhaḥ [v41]“By giving transcendental instructions to those who are faithless and averse to God, we cause them to become offenders.” Hence, Shree Krishna describes the disqualifications for listeners in the above verse.",it explained previous verse one situated loving devotion god sin giving material duties however one problem instruction if not yet become established love god prematurely give material duties neither thus karm sanyās qualified and qualified determined guru knows capabilities stringency paths if student wishes become graduate not directly go attend graduation ceremony we begin studies sequentially grade one similarly vast majority people eligible karm yog would great folly prematurely take karm sanyās it better instruct fulfill bodily dharma practice devotion alongside that verse shree krishna says confidential teaching given not everyone before sharing others check eligibility teachingthis word caution applies specifically confidential teachings previous verse general entire message bhagavad gita if explained someone envious shree krishna person may respond shree krishna conceited he kept asking arjun glorify him by misunderstanding teachings faithless listener harmed divine message the padma purāṇ also states aśhraddadhāne vimukhe py aśhṛiṇvati yaśh chopadeśhaḥ śhivanāmāparādhaḥ by giving transcendental instructions faithless averse god cause become offenders hence shree krishna describes disqualifications listeners verse

He says such preachers first attain his para bhakti, and then attain him.The opportunity to engage ourselves in devotion is a special blessing of God, but the opportunity to help others engage in devotion is an even bigger blessing, which attracts the special grace of God. Whenever we share something good with others, we benefit from it too. When we share whatever knowledge we have with others, by grace our own knowledge increases as well. By often giving food to others, we never go hungry ourselves. Saint Kabir said:dāna diye dhana nā ghaṭe, nadī ghate na nīraapane hātha dekha lo, yoṅ kyā kahe kabīra [v42]“Wealth does not decrease by giving in charity; a river does not become narrow, though people take water from it. I am not saying this without basis; see it yourself in the world.” Thus, those who share the spiritual knowledge of the Bhagavad Gita with others receive the highest blessing themselves.",shree krishna declares consequence properly preaching message bhagavad gita he says preachers first attain para bhakti attain himthe opportunity engage devotion special blessing god opportunity help others engage devotion even bigger blessing attracts special grace god whenever share something good others benefit when share whatever knowledge others grace knowledge increases well by often giving food others never go hungry saint kabir said dāna diye dhana nā ghaṭe nadī ghate na nīraapane hātha dekha lo yoṅ kyā kahe kabīra wealth not decrease giving charity river not become narrow though people take water i not saying without basis see world thus share spiritual knowledge bhagavad gita others receive highest blessing

Moreover, nor will there be anyone else in the world dearer to Me than he.","Amongst all the gifts we can give to others, the gift of spiritual knowledge is one of the highest, because it has the capacity to transform the recipient eternally. King Janak had asked his Guru, “The transcendental knowledge you have bestowed upon me is so precious that I feel deeply indebted to you. What can I give you in return?” Guru Ashtavakra replied, “There is nothing you can give that will relinquish you from your debt. The knowledge I gave was divine and all that you possess is material. Worldly objects can never be a price for divine knowledge. But you can do one thing. If ever you find someone who is thirsty for this knowledge, share it with him.” Shree Krishna states here that he considers the sharing of the knowledge of the Bhagavad Gita as the highest loving service one can render to God. However, those who lecture on the Bhagavad Gita should not feel they are doing something very great. The proper attitude of the teacher is to see oneself as an instrument in the hands of God, and to accord all credit to the grace of the Lord.",amongst gifts give others gift spiritual knowledge one highest capacity transform recipient eternally king janak asked guru the transcendental knowledge bestowed upon precious i feel deeply indebted what i give return guru ashtavakra replied there nothing give relinquish debt the knowledge i gave divine possess material worldly objects never price divine knowledge but one thing if ever find someone thirsty knowledge share him shree krishna states considers sharing knowledge bhagavad gita highest loving service one render god however lecture bhagavad gita not feel something great the proper attitude teacher see oneself instrument hands god accord credit grace lord

This does not imply that we stop using the intellect; rather it means we utilize our intellect to the best of our ability in fulfilling his will for us. From the message of the Bhagavad Gita we understand what his will is.

Here, Shree Krishna reassures that if such people merely hear with faith, they will also benefit. God is seated within them; he will note their sincere endeavor and reward them for it. A story about a disciple of Jagadguru Shankaracharya, called Sananda, illustrates this point. He was illiterate and could not comprehend his Guru’s teaching as the other disciples could. But when Shankaracharya delivered the discourse, he would listen with rapt attention and great faith. One day, he was washing his Guru’s clothes on the other side of the river. It became time for the class, and the other disciples requested, “Guruji, please begin the class.” Shankaracharya replied, “Let us wait; Sananda is not here.” “But Guruji, he cannot understand anything,” the disciples urged. “That is true; still, he listens with great faith and so I do not wish to disappoint him,” said Shankaracharya.Then, to show the power of faith, Shankaracharya called out, “Sananda! Please come here.” On hearing his Guru’s words, Sananda did not hesitate. He ran on water. The story goes that wherever he placed his feet, lotus flowers sprang up to support him. He crossed over to the other bank and offered obeisance to his Guru. At that time, a stuti (verses in praise) of the Guru emanated from his mouth in sophisticated Sanskrit. The other disciples were amazed to hear this. Since, lotus flowers had bloomed under his feet, his name became “Padmapada,” meaning “the one with lotus flowers under the feet.” He became one of the four main disciples of Shankaracharya, along with Sureshwaracharya, Hastamalak, and Trotakacharya. In the above verse, Shree Krishna assures Arjun that even those who merely hear the sacred dialogue with great faith will gradually become purified.",not everyone intellect comprehend deep imports dialogue shree krishna arjun here shree krishna reassures people merely hear faith also benefit god seated within note sincere endeavor reward a story disciple jagadguru shankaracharya called sananda illustrates point he illiterate could not comprehend guru teaching disciples could but shankaracharya delivered discourse would listen rapt attention great faith one day washing guru clothes side river it became time class disciples requested guruji please begin class shankaracharya replied let us wait sananda not here but guruji not understand anything disciples urged that true still listens great faith i not wish disappoint said shankaracharyathen show power faith shankaracharya called sananda please come here on hearing guru words sananda not hesitate he ran water the story goes wherever placed feet lotus flowers sprang support he crossed bank offered obeisance guru at time stuti verses praise guru emanated mouth sophisticated sanskrit the disciples amazed hear since lotus flowers bloomed feet name became padmapada meaning one lotus flowers feet he became one four main disciples shankaracharya along sureshwaracharya hastamalak trotakacharya in verse shree krishna assures arjun even merely hear sacred dialogue great faith gradually become purified

I stand with my doubt removed; I shall follow Your instruction.","At the outset, Arjun was faced with a bewildering situation, and confused about his duty in the situation. Overwhelmed with sorrow, he had sat down on his chariot, and gave up his weapons. He had confessed that he could find no remedy to the grief that attacked his body and senses. But he now finds himself completely transformed, and announces that he is situated in knowledge and no longer perplexed. He has given himself to the will of God and shall do what Shree Krishna instructed him to do. This was the impact of the message of Bhagavad Gita upon him. However, he adds tvat prasādān mayāchyuta, meaning, “O Shree Krishna, it was not just your lecture, but your grace that dispelled my ignorance.”Material knowledge does not require grace. We can pay the educational institute or teacher and receive knowledge in return, but spiritual knowledge can neither be purchased nor sold. It is offered through grace and received through faith and humbleness. Thus, if we approach the Bhagavad Gita with an attitude of pride, “I am so intelligent. I will evaluate what the net worth of this message is,” we will never be able to comprehend it. Our intellect will find some apparent defect in the scripture to dwell upon, and on that pretext we will reject the entire scripture as incorrect. There have been so many commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita and innumerable readers of the divine message in the last 5,000 years, but how many people have become enlightened like Arjun? If we wish to truly receive this knowledge, we must not merely read it, but also attract Shree Krishna’s grace with an attitude of faith and loving surrender.
